### Serverless Handbook for Frontend Engineers – free chapter

Dive modern backend. Understand any backend.

> Serverless Handbook taught me high-leveled topics. I don't like recipe courses and these chapters helped me to feel like I'm not a total noob anymore.

> The hand-drawn diagrams and high-leveled descriptions gave me the feeling that I don't have any critical "knowledge gaps" anymore.

> ~ Marek C, engineer
