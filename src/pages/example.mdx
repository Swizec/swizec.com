Pragmatic Programmer is a book everyone should read at the start of their career. The earlier the better.

Don't be like me and wait until every lesson is a _"Oh yeah, learned that the hard way"_ ... _"Hah yes! That was a fun and painful lesson"_ ... _"ooo good one! I remember a project just like that. Fuck that hurt"_
