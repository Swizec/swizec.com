## The story

When I came to Silicon Valley in 2015 I thought I was the shit. Able to solve any tech problem you threw at me, running circles around complexity, eating bugs for breakfast. Got my first Senior Software Engineer title and a 6-figure paycheck. Top of the world üöÄ

3 years later the startup ran its first performance review. I walked into that room full of myself. Definitely the best engineer on the team, solving the hardest problems, writing the best code. Crushing it.

The CTO took a deep breath and said *"Swizec, you're a great programmer, the best we've got. Everything else, though ... terrible. You'd be fired if it wasn't for your history with the founders and the fact your immigration is tied to this job"*

I was crushed.

How can you be both the best engineer *and* failing as a senior engineer? What's going on here?

I made it my mission to figure that out and wrote essays along the way. The [Senior Engineer Mindset ebook](/senior-mindset) is the collection of my best essays on the mindset of a true senior engineer. The tips and tricks that unlocked my career.

My hope is that these 26 essays help you too.

## Testimonials

![Message from a fan](../images/senior-mindset-message-from-a-fan.jpg)

Next day he got an offer $20,000 above his current gig ü•≥

The [Senior Engineer Mindset ebook](/senior-mindset) started as an email series. Here's what some of those early readers had to say:

> Before joining I was worried that senior mindset will be filled with useless information without actionable steps.
> But I learned the bigger picture about software development. That sometimes it's not only about code and best practises in the codebase
> I've recommended Senior Mindset to my friends.
> It's beneficial to junior/medior developers to connect the dots and I'm using what I learned to advance in my career, be a better person/developer and build something freaking cool.

---

> Reading the email series I learned to step back, observe, try to see the bigger picture, see what is the problem and how I can contribute the most with minimal effort
> I loved the format really...It is short, I can read it over breakfast
> and I'd recommend it to a friend. Any literature which is easy to read and teaches about something that you want to learn is worth picking up
> I'll apply it to my day to day job

---

> no hesitation subscribing.
> I learned that I should be focusing on amplifying my area of influencee
> The senior mindset is well written. It speaks to me.
> Got me into the googl engineering book
> I would recommend it to my friends, but it is not in german
> Going to use what I learned to help my customers, help my team, help my company to develop better

---

> loved learning the mindset! :) also, the stories and examples help me to assess if I'm following the right path.
> The 2 most helpful articles were the one about "what does a senior engineer do anyway" and "skate to where the puck goes". it helped remind me how to navigate my career and what skills I need to succeed.
> It helps reading things from someone else's point of view
> I'd recommend it to a friend, because it's been helpful to me
> Going to use what I learned for my own career. I'm kind of stuck in this limbo where I know I'm doing senior-level work, but I am not getting recognized for it. also when I interview, I get downleveled.

---

> I learned the habits that I have to change to become a senior engineer. The writing was very easy to follow and concise.
> I'd recommend this to a friend. Really liked how the author's experience was distilled into easy to digest essays/articles. They were also quite easy to implement
> Going to use this to move up my career ladder

---

> I felt that I got a ton of lessons from someone far more experienced and lessons that were hard earned, without having to learn them myself. I liked that the insights shared were very well written, and practical and actionable from my (not so senior) position.
> I learned a lot about the different possibilities for my career. i.e. startup vs big company, slowly writing less code to become an enabler and force multiplier for others, and how that's actually the proper career path and ideal for the future.
> It's a fantastic series that I really enjoyed and I think any developer could get a lot out of.
> I'm going to use this knowledge to develop my career in an intentional way, rather than just getting automatically somewhat better over time.

## Frequently asked questions

**Will there be an audiobook?** Would love to! No concrete plans right now.

**If you write a new essay, will it arrive in my inbox?** Yes! You'll get all future writings on this topic. The best will be added as chapters to the book.

**Why isn't this a paperback?** Self published paperbacks have terrible margins and I'd rather you have a more accessible price point :) My hope is that a future v2 of this book can be one of those NYT bestsellers you see in every book store ü§û
