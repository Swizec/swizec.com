ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Swizec - a geek with a hat ![](/favicon.png) - and 13 years ago I was just like you: starting my career.

Looking for "real" engineering jobs, dreaming of FAANG, and making 7/hour building websites. Europe ain't no San Francisco that's for sure ðŸ˜…

Through hard work and perseverance, I made it into Silicon Valley ðŸ’ª Got a high 6-figure job, a nice sidehustle, and plenty in the bank.

**Now I want to show you everything I learned** both technical and not. **Mindsets, tactics, and technical skills**.

Here's how I help beyond the newsletter ðŸ‘‡
