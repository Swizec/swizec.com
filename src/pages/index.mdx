# Read Software Engineering Lessons from Production

Hi I'm Swizec ðŸ‘‹

![](../images/react-summit-close-2.jpeg)

I write emails with real insight into the career and skills of a modern software engineer. **_"Raw and honest from the heart!"_** as one reader described them. Fueled by **lessons learned over 20 years** of building **production code** for side-projects, small businesses, and hyper growth startups. Both successful and not.

> your emails are one of the few resources I've found that go much farther than, like, all the resources I'm accessing on a regular basis. I find the emails help guide my self-teaching approach to make choices that produce meaningful engagement

Learning from tutorials is great! You follow some steps, learn a smol lesson, and feel like you got this. Then you go into an interview, get a question from the boss, or encounter a new situation and o-oh.

I aim to bring you the good stuff you only learn by doing. To expose the seedy underbelly of production code. The good bits that take months and years to find.

[Read JavaScript and TypeScript lessons from production](/collections/javascript/)

</Heading>

I took a bet on JavaScript in 2005 when it was known as DHTML. It's been my favorite language ever since. Since 2019, I've been full into TypeScript â€“Â perfect balance between flexibility and correctness.

[Read about indie hacking from the trenches](/collections/indie-hacking/)

</Heading>

Indie Hacking has been near and dear to me for over a decade. Diversifying your income is a wonderful habit. I don't write about running a side business as much as I used to, but many of these lessons permeate my approach to software engineering and the Senior Mindset.
