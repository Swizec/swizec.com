# Read Software Engineering Lessons from Production

Hi I'm Swizec ðŸ‘‹

![](../images/react-summit-close-2.jpeg)

I write emails with real insight into the career and skills of a modern software engineer. **_"Raw and honest from the heart!"_** as one reader described them. Fueled by **lessons learned over 20 years** of building **production code** for side-projects, small businesses, and hyper growth startups. Both successful and not.

> your emails are one of the few resources I've found that go much farther than, like, all the resources I'm accessing on a regular basis. I find the emails help guide my self-teaching approach to make choices that produce meaningful engagement

Learning from tutorials is great! You follow some steps, learn a smol lesson, and feel like you got this. Then you go into an interview, get a question from the boss, or encounter a new situation and o-oh.

I aim to bring you the good stuff you learn by doing. To expose the seedy underbelly of production code.
