# Read Software Engineering Lessons from Production

Hi I'm Swizec ðŸ‘‹

I write emails with real insight into the career and skills of a modern software engineer. **_"Raw and honest from the heart!"_** as one reader described them. Fueled by **lessons learned over 20 years** of building **production code** for side-projects, small businesses, and hyper growth startups. Both successful and not.

> your emails are one of the few resources I've found that go much farther than, like, all the resources I'm accessing on a regular basis. I find the emails help guide my self-teaching approach to make choices that produce meaningful engagement
