I love job interviews. It's a bit of a hobby really. You get this brief chance to dip your toes in a company's culture, to see what they're all about and how they work. If you're lucky, you get to talk to some awesome engineers who are much better than you. If you're _really_ lucky, you even get to travel for a few days! You can never have too many excuses to travel. [I spent last week in Canada](http://swizec.com/blog/canada-eh/swizec/6102) interviewing with [Shopify](http://shopify.com "Shopify").

## Decisions

I'm not sure I ever got a chance to talk to the engineer who made the initial recommendation based on my blogpost, but I definitely got to talk to a bunch of great people and had massive fun. A few days after coming home I got a call saying they're interested. Now I have to make a tough life changing decision between Shopify, freelancing and two other job jobs that have magically landed on my table when I was looking the other way ...
