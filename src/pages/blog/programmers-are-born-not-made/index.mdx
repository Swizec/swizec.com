## The non-programming sheep

[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/ "Jeff Atwood") wrote about \_[Separating Programming Sheep from Non-Programming Goats](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html)\_in 2006 where he mentions a study that claims to have found a test to predict future programming ability.The test is really simple:

```undefined
a = 5
b = 20
a = b

What are a and be now?
```

And some more questions like that. Only **44%** of the students formed a consistent [mental model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model "Mental model") of assignment - even a wrong one. The rest failed or didn't answer the questions. Worse still, after a semester of learning to program, the numbers were the same. Only 44% of the students understood how assignment works. Some people just dont _get_ it. Apparently. But I think there's an even simpler test ->

## Passion.
