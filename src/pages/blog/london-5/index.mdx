Oh but I have been neglecting you my lovelies haven&#x27;t I? It&#x27;s all for a good reason and I should be able to apologize, but you know, I don&#x27;t do that. So let&#x27;s just get on with it as if I did post on each day of the last three.

Yesterday I went to see Cabaret with the loveliest of things last night. I&#x27;m not quite certain because of which the evening was the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but let&#x27;s, for my own safety, say it was because of the play. The young thing is taken after all and I&#x27;m a man of honour.

Cabaret was probably the best live performance I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. It was just marvelously magnificent and I suggest everyone to go and watch it. You must! There&#x27;s a lot of singing and dancing and even quite some nudity, both male and female, but us theatre goers find that rather normal by now. Nudity everywhere. I laughed almost the whole evening away and I will most assuredly go see the slovene version when I come home.

The lovely young thing I mentioned was Peaches, my long time chatslave person from england and I have to admit meeting her would be more awkward, but it all went as if we&#x27;d been long time real life buddies who just so happened not to have seen each other in two days. Really, there&#x27;s more awkwardnes meeting my buddies after a week or two.

Should&#x27;ve taken a photo ...
