Some of you might remember my taking a [Mensa approved IQ test](http://swizec.com/blog/took-iq-test-found-problem/2/388) about a week ago, well today, finally, results came in and what I found out was surprisingiy similar to what I&#x27;d already known. My IQ seems to be 134, which is supposedly in the top 6% of the human population - not perfect, but good enough I say, I&#x27;ve got objective proof that I&#x27;m smart rather than stupid as I so often feel I am.

But how on earth did I know I&#x27;d get about that result? Online IQ tests to be honest, for some reason I&#x27;ve been nearly obsessed with knowing my IQ for the past few years and have thus solved many online tests. Some better, some worse. The results, accordingly, varied quite a lot, but a clear median shined out from the masses and that was 130-ish.

See, I knew enough not to trust the tests that want to sell me their results, the whole point of those is giving a high score so you&#x27;d be tempted to buy the advanced results. I also knew not to trust the tests that asked for too much knowledge because hey, how am I supposed to know what a friggin&#x27; nickel or dime is?

Lately, however, I&#x27;ve solved [the facebook IQ test](http://apps.facebook.com/advancediqtest/) and found it to be the most accurate of them all and it in fact showed a result quite similar to that of Mensa&#x27;s test. Facebook says my IQ is 143 and given the fact that performance can vary between days, that I took the facebook test in my natural environment, nighttime, and some other factors, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a rather accurate way of gleaning one&#x27;s IQ.
