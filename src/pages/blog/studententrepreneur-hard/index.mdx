Yesterday I gave a guest talk sort of thing at the Jobfair on my faculty. The point was to perform the function of a live demo for my startup incubator and help them get more startups that way. My personal point was to get some blokes to go _&quot;HEY! I wanna to help with that too!&quot;, _which of course did not happen because the audience was mostly electronics and hardware people. But nevertheless, it was a lovely chat. Although, I noticed a very interesting trend. None of them felt very keen on becoming entrepreneurs while still at uni. They thought it was too hard, that next to classes and studying they don&#x27;t really have time to do anything else. Hell, I even got an almostpplause for being such an impressive lad that I can do both AND keep a girlfriend. But seriously, it&#x27;s not hard at all. Just take this week&#x27;s Tuesday as an example:

> On Tuesday I worked for nine hours, five of which were studying/taking a hard maths exam (I count school as work because it&#x27;s my &quot;job&quot;). I went to the playhouse and I watched an episode of [House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_%28TV_series%29 "House (TV series)"). I also helped my girlfriend prepare a presentation for school. And I still went to bed by midnight.

See, it&#x27;s _that_ fucking hard! Not only have I never passed as many exams as I have now that I&#x27;m also an [entrepreneur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur "Entrepreneur"), I&#x27;ve also taken up a new sport (boxing), which takes six hours out of every week. Sure it&#x27;s not all fun and games and many people find it difficult to jam 60 to 70 working hours into every week. But if you think being a student and an entrepreneur is hard, you&#x27;re trippin&#x27; man. Seriously. Just get off yer arse and _do_ it. The television and alcohol can take care of themselves.
