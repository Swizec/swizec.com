A couple hours ago [@donalddesantis](https://twitter.com/#!/donalddesantis) posted an awesome post about _[What being hopelessly single taught him about pitching tech Celebs](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/hopelessly-single-taught-pitching-tech-celebs) \_on Geekwire_. _It&#x27;s really useful if you need that kick in the arse to just go meet people. Seriously, what are you doing standing around at a tech/entrepreneur conference not having epic chats with cool people? Don&#x27;t be silly. \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; caption=&quot;Image via Wikipedia&quot;][![Jude Law as Dan(Closer)]( "Jude Law as Dan(Closer)")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jude_Law_as_Dan%28Closer%29.jpg)\[/caption]He ties the advice with his experience of picking up cute women in public situations. The basic premise is \_just do it_. But I think he&#x27;s wrong about girls. _The rest of this post is completely my personal experience as a geek and a nerd who finds public situations to be draining and just plain difficult, but does it anyway. Your mileage may vary._ Donald says his revelation came when he suddenly realized that his &quot;game&quot; of standing around at bars, waiting for women to start talking to him wasn&#x27;t working _at all_. Here&#x27;s the thing though, if you go to a bar and just sort of stand around ... girls will come talk to you. In fact this will happen more than once a night. _Especially_ if you look like you&#x27;re having fun on your own and are totally content with yourself. I think it irks them that there is this guy who isn&#x27;t paying attention to their &quot;come talk to me&quot; vibes. So they come talk to you instead. Further on Donald lists three traits guys think they need to get girls:

> _Be a great dancer (tech corollary: slick demo/pitch)_ _Surround yourself with a coterie of other attractive women (tech corollary: a coterie of other investors or “cool kids”)_ _Have charm like [Hugh Grant](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hugh_grant "Hugh Grant"), with a face like [Jude Law](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jude_law "Jude Law") (tech corollary: Have charm like Hugh Grant, with a face like Jude Law)_

Honestly, you don&#x27;t need to know how to dance. If you just go out there and _dance like nobody&#x27;s watching_. Girls will come dance with you. Tried and proven. You don&#x27;t even have to know what you&#x27;re doing, you just have to be comfortable with yourself. Surrounding yourself with girls, unfortunately, does not work at all. I&#x27;m often out with a group of female friends and, without fault, on those nights not a single girl comes talk to me. They usually just assume I&#x27;m taken or otherwise reserved for the night. Don&#x27;t do that. Being charming like Hugh Grant or sexy like Jude Law definitely helps with being a heart-throb, but girls look for average (evolution etc.). You know how hotties look intimidating to you and like you could never get them since they&#x27;re way out of your league? Yeah, that&#x27;s how girls feel about Jude Law. Not a good strategy at all. Just be charming enough not to step on too many toes and remember to smile. It works wonders ... especially once you cross a line or ten. Smiling and being nice about it smooths everything over. Donald also says that getting girls&#x27; numbers is apparently Hard Business (tm):

> I didn’t get the first phone number I asked for, nor the second. In fact, the first number probably came somewhere between tries five and ten. But with each rejection, beliefs #1 and #2 became less false. I also become much more comfortable at getting a conversation rolling. Mastery through repetition.

I don&#x27;t know about you, but I have so far gotten every single phone number I actually _asked for_. Turns out people find it really really difficult to turn down polite requests. If you ask for something nicely, you will get it almost without fault. Just be nice, don&#x27;t look creepy and never ask for a number right off the cuff. Chances are the girl won&#x27;t think twice about giving it to you. Why would she? Here&#x27;s a nice guy making a polite request, she has no reason to turn you down. Especially if you promise to call her about something friendly ... had a cool conversation about something she&#x27;s good at? Get her number in case you ever need an expert on hand. Works every time. But it&#x27;s very very important that you _actually ask_. Being a geek and a nerd I usually forget this part. Hell, I&#x27;ve had people chasing after me because I will just wander off in the middle of a cool conversation without asking for a phone number. It&#x27;s unfortunate when that happens with a hottie (and it does happen, except they don&#x27;t chase after you but stand there baffled and confused). Mostly the whole thing is really easy. Relax, talk like you&#x27;re talking to a long lost friend, give them a way to help you, be nice and avoid being generic like it&#x27;s the plague. PS: before you think I&#x27;m super successful with the ladies, I&#x27;m not, I usually end up friendzoning them because I forget that they might like me. There were even occasions where I had a girl in my room and the thought she might like me never even crossed my mind. PPS: the standing around minding your own business play works so well girls will sometimes ask _you_ for _your_ number.
