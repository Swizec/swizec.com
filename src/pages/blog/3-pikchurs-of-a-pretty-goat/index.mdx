While I was browsing through my blackberry a few moments ago to find a certain photo I stumbled upon some photos I took this Christmas.

They're of a very bloody cute small boy goat thing. My grandmother says this is as big as they get and by god the little rascals are awesome. Soon as I came into the barn this guy jumped on me and demanded petting!

PETTING!

A goat!!

:D

Here he is, now let's make him famous just because he's so cool.
