While I was browsing through my blackberry a few moments ago to find a certain photo I stumbled upon some photos I took this Christmas. They&#x27;re of a very bloody cute small boy goat thing. My grandmother says this is as big as they get and by god the little rascals are awesome. Soon as I came into the barn this guy jumped on me and demanded petting! PETTING! A goat!! :D Here he is, now let&#x27;s make him famous just because he&#x27;s so cool.
