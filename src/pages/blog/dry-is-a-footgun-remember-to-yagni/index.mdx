DRY is the first of the big rules engineers learn. Do not Repeat Yourself.



It&#x27;s a good rule. You&#x27;ll figure it out on your own even if nobody teaches you.



_&quot;Make a button&quot;_



Okay, you can write a component like this:



```
const Button = () => (
    Button
);
```



_&quot;I want to have a button that says Button and a button that says Click Me&quot;_



You got it!



```
const Button = () => (
    Button
);

const ClickMe = () => (
    ClickMe
);
```



_&quot;Now I want Button to open the shopping cart and I want ClickMe to close the page.&quot;_



Okay, we can do that.



```
const Button = () => (
    Button
);

const ClickMe = () => (
    ClickMe
);
```



_&quot;Wonderful. Beautiful buttons. I want a third button, and this one should close the currently open modal.&quot;_



Ah, this is getting tedious. Are you going to want many more buttons?



_&quot;Yeah, maybe?&quot;_



Okay. Let me DRY this up.



```
const GenericButton = ({ onClick, label }) => (
    {label}
)

const Button = () => (
    
)

const ClickMe = () => (
    
)

const CloseModal = () => (
    
)
```



_&quot;Wonderful. Can we make all those buttons 20px font?&quot;_



Yes, of course!



You&#x27;ve just DRY&#x27;d up your code, and here&#x27;s your first victory. Buttons use a common underlying component. Giving them all a big font is easy. You got dis.



```
const GenericButton = ({ onClick, label }) => (
    
        {label}
    
)
```



All your buttons now have a bigger font. DRY Magic.

A true victory for engineering. You pat yourself on the back for an architecture well designed, code cleaned up. You followed some great engineering principles! 👏



**But you just shot yourself in the foot.**



Next week, your PM comes back and says, _&quot;Button must be green, ClickMe should be blue, and CloseModal is red&quot;_



Okay, that&#x27;s annoying, why 3 different buttons, but you can extend `GenericButton` to accept styling. You&#x27;ve still got dis.



```
const GenericButton = ({ onClick, label, style }) => (
    
        {label}
    
)

const Button = () => (
    
)

const ClickMe = () => (
    
)

const CloseModal = () => (
    
)
```



You had to add styles to every call of `GenericButton`, but that&#x27;s okay. At least you have components so you didn&#x27;t have to find every single invocation of any button and change them.



That&#x27;s the power of DRY. Change once, fix everywhere.



Then your PM says _&quot;The font on CloseModal is too big&quot;_



A-ha! You were smart. You wrote `GenericButton` so styles provided through props can overwrite default styles.



`{{ fontSize: 20, ...style }}` versus `{{ ... style, fontSize: 20 }}`.

_&quot;CloseModal and Button should be disabled when they&#x27;re inactive&quot;_



Hmm… 2 of your 3 buttons need new behavior. Best add it to the base implementation.



```
const GenericButton = ({ onClick, label, active, style }) => (
    
        
        {label}
    
)
```



You change `Button` and `ClickMe` to set the `active` prop based on some state.



And `ClickMe` became disabled too? That&#x27;s weird.



Guess you have to change that one so it&#x27;s always passing `active=true`. That&#x27;s weird.



Why would a button always proclaim itself as active? Buttons should be active by default, and this feature should exist only for buttons that use it.



You adapt the code.



```
const GenericButton = ({ onClick, label, active, style }) => {
    active = active === undefined ? true : active;
    
    return (
        
            
            {label}
        
    )
}
```



Now `active` is `true` when undefined, and whatever you set otherwise.



## The DRY footgun



Your `GenericButton` is starting to swell with edge cases. As time passes, it&#x27;s going to get worse and worse.



You&#x27;ll add a loading state. But only some buttons will use it. You&#x27;ll add hover/unhover behavior. But not all buttons want that.



Eventually, you&#x27;ll have a button with so many features it&#x27;s impossible to use. Every render requires so many props that you might as well write a whole button from scratch.



Happens a lot.

## YAGNI to the rescue



[YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren&#x27;t_gonna_need_it), ya ain&#x27;t gonna need it, is a programming philosophy that engineers learn a little later in life.



Because it takes a while for those DRY footguns to appear, perhaps. Or because many projects don&#x27;t live long enough to see it. Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of thinking about why your code is suffering.



YAGNI often comes in 2 shapes 👇



**The first** is like the above. You spotted an opportunity to optimize, but you were too early. You should avoid generalizing code until it is absolutely obvious that you should.



The more use-cases you have, the easier to know what to generalize. I mean, how can you know which functionality your components share if you don&#x27;t even have those components yet?



You can&#x27;t.



And that brings us to **the other YAGNI**: Building stuff you think you&#x27;ll need before you need it.



You think of a wonderful abstraction. A wonderful little feature that&#x27;s gonna help oh so much in the future.



You build it.



Months pass. You tweak the code here and there. Nobody&#x27;s using it, but you have to maintain otherwise it&#x27;s gonna break. Whenever you implement a feature, you have to think about how it impacts this code you&#x27;ve got.



It&#x27;s slowing you down. Making you think. And you aren&#x27;t even using it.



But one day! One glorious day, your PM gives you a task. A task from the gods. You are about to use this code you predicted 6 months ago!



You are a god of prediction! You knew it all along!



![](./img/media-ibGFpMv1Uoais-giphy.gif)



You delete your code and start from scratch. The feature is so different that you can&#x27;t use any of it.
