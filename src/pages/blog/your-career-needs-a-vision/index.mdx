In his book, The Art of Science and Engineering, Richard Hamming says the key to a great career is vision.

He likens your career to a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). A meandering path through the unknown where each step goes in a random direction.

No matter how fast you walk, [how often you change jobs](https://swizec.com/blog/what-if-engineers-were-paid-like-athletes/), you'll never make it farther than the square root of the number of steps – `Math.sqrt(n)`.

You can grind out more steps [name|] but it's gonna be one hell of a grind. You'll burn out before you get anywhere.

Now look what happens when you add vision.

<RandomWalk />

Each step is random, but they're biased towards a vision. You travel a distance proportional to `n` – almost straight!

## What's going on here

What's your vision [name|my friend]?
