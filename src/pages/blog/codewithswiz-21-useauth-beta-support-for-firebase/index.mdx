It works! [useAuth](https://useAuth.dev) has beta-level support for Firebase Auth ü•≥ I did not expect that to take 3 sessions.

Are you a Firebase user? Can you [please try it out](https://github.com/Swizec/useAuth/pull/148) and tell me what's missing. It would mean a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

_CodeWithSwiz is a weekly live show. Like a podcast with video and fun hacking. Focused on experiments and open source. [Join live Mondays](https://youtube.com/swizecteller)_

We got to a working proof of concept in [last week's episode](https://swizec.com/blog/codewithswiz-20-adding-firebase-support-to-useauth-pt2). Rough UI, transitions bad, state machines not synced, and we knew it worked because `console.log` spat out a user.

Encouraging but not useful.

This episode was about polishing that turd into a useful beta. Improve the config experience, sync Firebase's and useAuth's state machines, recover sessions on page load, tighten up TypeScript types.

And as a bonus, we ran into ye olde `this` problem. Thought those days were behind me ü•≤

## Improve the config experience

You want to reduce moving parts while prototyping. Make sure you can move fast and ignore fiddly details.

Hardcoding config is a time-honored tradition. A great way to leak your API keys on GitHub and [get an AWS account shut down](https://swizec.com/blog/what-happens-when-you-push-aws-credentials-to-github), too.

Here's how it works now:

```javascript
// as a user

<AuthConfig
  authProvider={FirebaseUI}
  navigate={navigate}
  params={{
    // Firebase standard practice to copypasta this blob?
    firebaseConfig: {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyCdtQ6V3qDxpgDO-usa3zWvBhIJKpAd4mM",
      authDomain: "useauth-demo.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "useauth-demo",
      storageBucket: "useauth-demo.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "520315046120",
      appId: "1:520315046120:web:4384141e88f49e638c215d",
    },
  }}
/>
```

Reading Firebase docs, it sounds like copy-pasting your `firebaseConfig` object is standard practice. Go into the dashboard, click a button, paste into your project.

Keeping things familiar so users don't get scared ‚úåÔ∏è

### Passing an initialized app

You might have a Firebase app in your stack already. For authentication or otherwise.

When you pass `firebaseConfig` useAuth initializes a new app for itself. That might not be a good idea.

Instead, you can pass an existing initialized firebase app.

```javascript
// as a user
<AuthConfig
  authProvider={FirebaseUI}
  navigate={navigate}
  params={{
    // pass initialized app
    firebaseApp: Firebase,
  }}
/>
```

A conditional in `FirebaseUI` takes the params object and decides which path to take.

```typescript
// src/providers/FirebaseUI.ts

if (params.firebaseConfig) {
  this.firebase = Firebase.initializeApp(params.firebaseConfig, "useAuth")
} else if (params.firebaseApp) {
  this.firebase = params.firebaseApp
} else {
  throw "Please provide firebaseConfig or initialized firebaseApp"
}
```

If there's no config, we throw an error. I hope it's a helpful error ... wish I knew how to encode that in TypeScript. Feels like the type system should enforce conditionally optional params ü§î

## Sync Firebase's and useAuth's state machines

You can think of Firebase and useAuth as 2 state machines running side by side. Firebase keeps track of user state, useAuth wants to keep track of user state.

![useAuth's state machine](./img/useAuths-state-machine8f2801.png)

Syncing state machines is a notoriously difficult problem. You try to figure it out and after 3 days you say _"Damn it, why didn't I read a book first?"_

Your best bet is the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern). If the target state machine supports it. Otherwise the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) works fine.

You end up with a system like this:

0.  useAuth subscribes to Firebase
1.  User does a thing
2.  Firebase changes state
3.  Firebase tells useAuth
4.  useAuth changes state
5.  useAuth hook updates return values
6.  React re-renders affected components

Two machines weakly communicating through events, independently changing their internal state. ü§ò

In code you get this:

```typescript
// src/providers/FirebaseUI.ts

constructor(params: AuthOptions & FirebaseOptions) {
    // ...

    // Auth state observer
    this.firebase
        .auth()
        .onAuthStateChanged(this.onAuthStateChanged.bind(this));
}

private onAuthStateChanged(user: Firebase.User | null) {
    if (user) {
        this.dispatch("LOGIN");
        this.dispatch("AUTHENTICATED", {
            user: this.firebase.auth().currentUser,
            authResult: {
                // needed for useAuth to work
                expiresIn: 3600
            }
        });
    }
}
```

We subscribe to auth changes with a callback function. The function checks for a user, if one is present, it goes through useAuth events to log you in.

We dispatch the `LOGIN` _and_ `AUTHENTICATED` events because [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) doesn't allow jumping ahead. As it shouldn't. But we don't know when this code runs ‚Äì¬†could be on init before we start logging in.

Might need to dispatch `LOGOUT` when there's no user ü§î

## Recover sessions on page load

[useAuth](https://useauth.dev) has built-in support for validating user sessions on page load. That's like a core value prop.

To make that happen, it uses a side-effect to call a `checkSession` function on the auth provider. That method is meant to phone home, check your cookies, whatever it needs to decide _"Is the current user still the current user?"_

Firebase makes that part pretty okay:

```typescript
public async checkSession(): Promise<{
    user: AuthUser;
    authResult: Auth0DecodedHash;
}> {
    // verify session is still valid
    // return fresh user info
    const user = this.firebase.auth().currentUser;

    if (user) {
        // throws if user no longer valid
        await user.reload();

        return {
            user,
            authResult: {
                // needed for useAuth to work
                expiresIn: 3600
            }
        };
    } else {
        throw new Error("Session invalid");
    }
}
```

Grab the current user from Firebase, reload their info, return user object and fake an `expiresIn` timer to keep useAuth happy.

I considered storing the `user.toJSON()` version of the user object, but that strips away Firebase methods. Figured people used to Firebase would want to keep those.

Although the object is gnarly as heck ...

## The dreaded `this`

This part.

```typescript
// Auth state observer
this.firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(this.onAuthStateChanged.bind(this))
```

Bloody hell I can't remember the last time I had to manually bind a function to its object. Nice reminder that `class FirebaseUI {}` is syntax sugar for dark magic from 2010.

Forget to bind and `onAuthStateChanged` doesn't know which object it belongs to when called as a callback. Throws cryptic errors. üôÉ

And we got a working beta version.

But I don't know what's missing. Need to play around more, try different configurations and authentication modes. Figure out how to make developer experience better

Are you a Firebase user? Can you [please try it out](https://github.com/Swizec/useAuth/pull/148) and tell me what's missing. It would mean a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
