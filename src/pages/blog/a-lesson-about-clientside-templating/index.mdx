1.  Server is just a DB interface, means less melting servers
2.  Effect similar to progressive loading, means users _see something immediately _- makes waiting easier
3.  Using powerful client machines to do the heavy UX lifting
4.  I may have had some other points :P

## The lesson

![]()![A stats screenie](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-16-at-1.53.20-PM-300x175.png "A stats screenie")![]()\_\_\_\_

```html
<img title="${the_title}" src="${url_var}" alt="" />
```

Everything marked as a variable gets replaced with its value and everyone can be happy. Try to guess what happens with that _src="\\\${url_var}"_ bit in there. Yep, the browser tries to load it. Firing a request to something that always returns at least a 404 after wordpress decides that, hey, this isn't something I know of! This means that the url is _never_ cached either server-side \_or \_client-side! Turns out my blog was firing two such requests every time somebody came to the page. Every. Single. Time! In the latest case this meant 8 useless request per second at its peak. To the point most of my site just started throwing a 500 error and only that one redirected static page was still up ... All I have to do now is find a permanent solution. Any ideas?
