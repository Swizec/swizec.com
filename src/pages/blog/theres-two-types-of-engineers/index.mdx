what kind of engineer are you?

Imagine there's a leak in your bathroom and you hire a plumber. Plumber shows up, looks at your bathroom and asks:

_"What do you want?"_

Err ... fix the leak?

_"Sure, how? Do you want a new pipe, bolt the nut, replace the gasket ... what do you want?"_

Heck if I know, you're the expert.

_"Sir, you need to tell me what you want, I can't read minds"_

You call a different plumber. You don't have time to become a bathroom expert.

The new plumber comes in, looks at your bathroom, turns off the main water valve to stop the leak, and says:

_"Judging from the toilet bowl, this place was last renovated in the late 90's. Means your pipes are rusting to hell and you're gonna have more of these issues. A full remodel will cost around $10,000 â€“ think about it in the next few years. Call me. Right now I think it's best we replace that gasket and weld a piece of metal where the pipe rusted through. Gonna be $500 in parts and labor. If that's too much, I can duck tape it for $50 and that should last a few months. I'll leave the roll of industrial strength plumber duck tape so you can do it yourself next time._

How does that feel? Which of these plumbers do you like more?

## The true goal of engineering

You don't hire an engineer to write code for you. You hire them to solve problems and [build assets that keep those problems solved](https://swizec.com/blog/why-engineers-are-worth-so-much/).

Usually that asset is code. But it doesn't have to be!

_"We should do this manually until we hit X scale"_ is a fantastic solution. The new business process is the asset.

When you build what you're told, you're making the asker do all the hard work. Client, boss, product manager, doesn't matter.

_They_ solve the problem, you wield the hammer.

But when you look at your job as "problem solver", _you_ do the hard work. You may not even do the hammering, that's what beginners are for ðŸ˜›

If you ask me, I love hammering ... but I've built enough forms to last a lifetime y'know?

Not everyone gets a team to work with, but imagine you did. Would you prefer to give exacting details and instructions, or to say _"Here's a subset of the problem, I think we can do X, make sure that's true and ping me with any issues"_?

## Selling hands vs. selling brains

The difference between code monkey engineers and problem solving engineers is this: Are you selling your hands or selling your brains?

**Selling your hands** makes you a fancy typist. Product owner designs the solution, tells you what to do, and you do it. Little value add.

**Selling your brains** means you're a partner. You create solutions, reduce the thinking work, find important edge cases they didn't even think of, _and push back when there's issues_.

The difference between _"I got you fam!"_ and _"What do you want?"_

And that shows up in your career. You go farther as a problem solver. The opportunities are bigger.
