Most of you probably don&#x27;t realise but Mr. Poe had his 200th birthday yesterday, which is a once in a lifetime event ... or for him a once in a post mortem event ... so I decided to at least raise a glass of cognac to his genius, if I can&#x27;t afford a trip to Boston. Air travel ticket prices bloody suck if you ask me, a three day trip to my favourite poet&#x27;s birthday party would cost upwards of a thousand euro just to get there and back. Let alone staying there for three days.

The most surprising thing about cognac was that it&#x27;s extremely expensive. I mean, 18 euro for a glass? What the fuck!? But I was assured it was a really good cognac with a bottle costing several hundred euro and since it was Poe&#x27;s birthday I decided to have the glass anyhow. Poor student and all.

Cognac, some Remy Martin thing, was absolutely divine! I loved it. The taste was lovably soft and gentle, the smell was magnificent and I loved the whole experience. However I wish I could have the cognac over Poe&#x27;s grave and &quot;talk&quot; to him about how much of an inspiration he&#x27;s been to me over the years and how I&#x27;ve read most of his works at least twice.

As a bit of trivia, did you know that every year on Poe&#x27;s birthday a misterious man nobody knows leaves a bottle of cognac and a glass on Poe&#x27;s grave? I&#x27;ve always found that very intriguing.
