## Brain wandering

You must let your brain wander! Aimlessly, without purpose, without even expecting a result. You must take the time out of your busy day to just let your brain wander without focusing on anything in particular and I promise you, great things will happen. Creativity is born out of random connections between different ideas. But you can't have random ideas if you never leave your brain alone. If you keep focusing you'll never find the solution staring at you from behind the hill. This problem is so well known machine learning and [artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") have developed a bunch of tactics to combat it - everything from simulated annealing to evolutionary approaches and often just simply adding a bunch of noise to the belief state. For me, the best brain wandering comes from watching television. Doing sports is great to relax your brain, but is also too involved for any deep thought. Reading books, great relaxation, but it pulls you in too much and you forget about everything else. TV, however, TV is just perfect. The stories are nice and predictable, no need to think, all the characters are always the same, most of your brain can be left to just passively take in images, while your imagination solves whatever problems have accumulated. It's a bit like dreaming really. A semi-vegetative state in which the brain has time to calmly digest.
