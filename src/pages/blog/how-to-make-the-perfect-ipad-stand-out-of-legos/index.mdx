Today I finally got fed up with the _"Make my [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/ "iPad") stand up"_ dance. You know the one:

_Leeeaaan the iPad ever so carefully against a stack of books. Slides. Falls. No good._

_Ok, maybe if I put some rubber bands under so it won't slip ..._

_Nope._

_Maybe if I wedge it juuuuust right between the notebook and the books ..._

After two years of dancing this dance - and being too cheap to buy a proper stand - I finally realized some of my [LEGO](http://www.lego.com/ "Lego")'s possess the perfect angles to prop it up just right.

## The LEGO iPad stand

After ~40 minutes of tinkering I had a stand. A simple, dare I say elegant?, stand. Only 30 pieces. Even the colours match so it's definitely the most beautiful LEGO creation I have ever made!

The angle did in fact turn out perfect. The whole thing is even sturdy enough to withstand wild tapping and swiping conditions. For bonus points, an iPhone also fits (I didn't plan this one).

Here's how you can make one yourself:
