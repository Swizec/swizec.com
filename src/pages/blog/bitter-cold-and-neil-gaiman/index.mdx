Today I woke up into a somewhat warm room, but my bed was warmer. So I hit snooze, I can afford five more minutes. Then I hit snooze again. And again. And again. Ok so it&#x27;s now been 30 minutes of snoozing in a warm bed. Fuck it, let&#x27;s turn off the alarm, I can be warm for another 15 minutes right? Yes, of course, but it turned into 45 minutes instead. Oops. A quick shower and clothing later and I&#x27;m already on my way to work.

Getting to work is a five minute walk for me. It was a cold morning, but a refreshing walk. I rather enjoyed it to be honest. But when I got to work something felt funny on my head, it was somewhat itchy and annoying. I go in to scratch it and ... lo and behold, my hair had frozen solid. What the fuck?

But anyway, I&#x27;ve been reading [Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Journal](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/) lately and I like it so much that I want to become one of those Neil Gaiman readers, so I&#x27;ve decided to write him this question:

_Dear Neil Gaiman,_

_I&#x27;m not a crazy fan and have until recently not even known you existed. That was, until I saw Amanda Palmer&#x27;s webcam stream from a dinner with friends she did a while ago (I AM a crazy fan of hers, I admit). You seemed like a cool guy so I decided to check out your blog. This was the epiphany when I realised she doesn&#x27;t say the Google You song was written by an &quot;unknown gamer&quot;, but by &quot;Neil Gaiman&quot;. Why those two sound so similar I don&#x27;t know, probably because I&#x27;m not english._

_Anyhow, I really like your blog and find it a delightful read. But seeming as how you write a lot more than just the blog and I&#x27;m becoming increasingly interested in reading your stuff, I was just wondering if you could make a recommendation on where to start? What would you say is your best work to reel in a new reader who has never had any contact with anything you&#x27;ve done?_

So yep, I&#x27;m just gonna go ahead and submit that through his &quot;ask Neil Gaiman&quot; thingy and hope for the best. Or can either of you readers suggest something?
