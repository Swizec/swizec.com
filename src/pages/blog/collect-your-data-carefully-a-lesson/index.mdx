```python
{'A': [[2, 3, -1], [3, 1, -1], [2, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1], ...],
'B': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...]
'C': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...], }
```

It pains me to admit it, but it took much too long to write a lens between the spreadsheet data and the data structure I can now actually use. Don't do this to yourselves and just make sure that whenever you are collecting data for a long lasting experiment, write some sort of easy interface that pops values right into the database. It will make your life easier.
