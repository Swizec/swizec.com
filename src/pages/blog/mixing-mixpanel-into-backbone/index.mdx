_&quot;Hey, so nobody&#x27;s looked at our [Mixpanel](http://www.mixpanel.com "Mixpanel") integration in months and the product has changed a lot, so uh ... can you fix that?&quot;_ Every developer&#x27;s favourite thing to hear. Logs and metrics going out of sync with the product they&#x27;re logging and metricsing. Always fun to fix ... How can we avoid ever fixing this again? We&#x27;d like an automagic logging or metrics system that fulfills two criteria:

- self-adapting
- doesn&#x27;t show up in the code

In my case, I had to fix an old javascript integration of Mixpanel. Our approach was a mix of globally assigning [event listeners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern "Observer pattern") and peppering our view/model/whatever code with `mixpanel.track` calls. The problem is that global event listeners will eventually fall out of sync when a class name changes or a link is removed. Peppering your code with calls to tracking code is even more brittle. Tracking calls are essentially comments on your code. Comments and code _always_ drift apart. Always. It&#x27;s just a fact. The same thing happens to tracking calls. Except it&#x27;s even worse than comments. At least comments are helpful in theory. Tracking code just muddies the logic of your functions. `do_something` becomes `do_something_and_track_business_event_X`. Of course you won&#x27;t name your functions like that because you&#x27;re not a tool, but you _have_ introduced an extra side-effect. Nobody likes strange side-effects. Especially the kind that make calls to remote services. Therefore, the only solution is moving tracking code an [abstraction layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer") higher. Instead of relying on everyone in the team to maintain tracking calls, move them into the framework they&#x27;re using. For us it&#x27;s Backbone. So last night I wrote a simple 30 line [mixin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin "Mixin") for Backbone views that makes sure we track _everything_.

```javascript
// copied straight from backbone
var delegateEventSplitter = /^(\S+)\s*(.*)$/;

// inspired by Backbone
Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents = _.wrap(
  Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents,
  function (fn, events) {
    if (!(events || (events = _.result(this, "events")))) return this;

    var track = _.bind(function (event) {
      var $target = $(event.currentTarget),
        event_name = $target.attr("data-mixpanel"),
        data = !!this.model ? this.model.toJSON() : {};

      if (event_name) {
        mixpanel.track(event_name, data);
      }
    }, this);

    for (var key in events) {
      var match = key.match(delegateEventSplitter),
        type = match[1],
        selector = match[2];

      if (type == "click" || type == "submit") {
        if (selector === "") {
          this.$el.on(type, track);
        } else {
          this.$el.on(type, selector, track);
        }
      }
    }

    return fn.apply(this);
  }
);
```

The code wraps and is heavily inspired by `Backbone.View.delegateEvents`, which is called when a new view is instantiated. Its job is to go through the events configuration hash and bind the view&#x27;s event listeners to correct events on particular [HTML elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element "HTML element"). Nifty. My mixin does the same, but only cares about `click` and `submit` events since those represent most user actions. Every such event is bound to a simple `track` function, which takes the `data-mixpanel` property from the element as an event&#x27;s business name, and uses the view&#x27;s whole model as [meta data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata"). I figured the more data we can collect the better. You never know what you&#x27;re going to need in the future. From now on, we just have to add a `data-mixpanel` property to any element whose user actions we want to track. No property, no tracking. Simple. And yes, I know what you&#x27;re thinking, _surely_ there&#x27;s already a plugin for this. There is, it&#x27;s called [backbone-mixpanel](https://github.com/bnorton/backbone-mixpanel). Looks like a pretty good solution, but for once I wanted to put my NotInventedHere blinds on and make something myself. :) Either way, this should remove the friction between us and good actionable metrics. PS: yes, before you get up in arms, I do need to add the code that cleans up events by wrapping the `Backbone.View.undelegateEvents` method.
