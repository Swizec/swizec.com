Every few days an email from Gojee winds up in my inbox with pictures of delicious delicious food to make me hungry. This week something came up that I \_wanted. \_It was a food so delicious looking I couldn't get it ouf o my head.

[Wild Mushroom Stroganoff](http://www.gojee.com/food/links/wild-mushroom-stroganoff).

After begging every female I know to make this, I finally resorted to making it myself today. Sure enough, right after I decided to make it myself a friendly female decided to lend a helping hand! Bastards.

By some act of magic or divine will I actually managed to buy all the correct ingredients on my first try, unlike when I was making cake.

That pan has butter in it! Butter! Terribly against any modern notion of not-very-fatty food, but it makes all the difference.

Somehow my version didn't look that much like foodporn, but damn it was delicious! Definitely going to be making this again and I think I should start using Gojee more often. They actually have some good food there.
