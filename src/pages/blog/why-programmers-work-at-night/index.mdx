A popular joke goes: _Programmers are machines that transform coffee into code._

Obviously this aludes to the copious amounts of caffeine that have become pretty much the staple of developer culture to the point I find it surprising that energy drink companies haven't started sponsoring developers.

Develop an argument around distractions and ability to schedule large swaths of time to actually get anything done because distractions are actually a much lesser problem than anticipation of abstractions - it being difficult to focus on a task if you know you will be distracted in an hour and that working is somehow made easier when you can just code away seemingly without a hard limit.

Perhaps tie this into the difficulty of predicting how long a programming task is actually going to take.
