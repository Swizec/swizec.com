Here I am. Here _we_ are, on a roadtrip of epic proportions ... or rather, as much as you can pack into ten days.

This is the main event of the summer, the reason I borrowed [@smotko](http://twitter.com/smotko)'s car. The plan is to make it down to [Dubrovnik](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95 "Old City of Dubrovnik") - some 600km away from home - visit [Bruce Lee](http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/ "Bruce Lee")'s statue in [Mostar](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.3333333333,17.8&spn=0.1,0.1&q=43.3333333333,17.8 (Mostar)&t=h> "Mostar"), then go visit some Croatian islands for a few days of proper lounging around the beach like a pair of cows.

Yesterday at ungodly hours in the morning the expedition was launched. So far the journey's included:

- hoards of cow-eyed tourists with their brain shut off, trying to take the single best picture of [Plitvice Lakes](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/98 "Plitvice Lakes National Park") ... no idea why they bothered, of course ours are going to be best.
- discovering [Croatia](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.8,16.0&spn=10.0,10.0&q=45.8,16.0 (Croatia)&t=h> "Croatia") is actually beautiful - but only inland [Dalmatia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia"), the [flatland on the way to EXIT](https://swizec.com/blog/geek-at-a-music-festival-day-1/ "Geek at a music festival: Day 1") was weird and the coast is full of lazy cowstourists
- a scary old house without working electricity
- sleeping on the balcony of said house ... and later inside, with all the ghosts keeping us company
- hydroelectric power plant _inside a fucking mountain_
- one of the best looking longboarding roads ever ... with _maaaaaaybe_ just a bit too much traffic ... maybe, we'll see, I might have to sneak out while [@ponywithhiccups](http://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) isn't looking
- huge wind tourbines! very huge!
- getting to know the interior of Car, very very well

Oh and we took some possibly good photos. Take a look, y'know, if you want to. I'm a blogpost not a cop.
