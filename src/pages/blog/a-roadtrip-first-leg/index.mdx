- hoards of cow-eyed tourists with their brain shut off, trying to take the single best picture of [Plitvice Lakes](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/98 "Plitvice Lakes National Park") ... no idea why they bothered, of course ours are going to be best.
- discovering [Croatia](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.8,16.0&spn=10.0,10.0&q=45.8,16.0 (Croatia)&t=h> "Croatia") is actually beautiful - but only inland [Dalmatia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia"), the [flatland on the way to EXIT](http://swizec.com/blog/geek-at-a-music-festival-day-1/swizec/4825 "Geek at a music festival: Day 1") was weird and the coast is full of lazy cowstourists
- a scary old house without working electricity
- sleeping on the balcony of said house ... and later inside, with all the ghosts keeping us company
- hydroelectric power plant _inside a fucking mountain_
- one of the best looking longboarding roads ever ... with _maaaaaaybe_ just a bit too much traffic ... maybe, we'll see, I might have to sneak out while [@ponywithhiccups](http://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) isn't looking
- huge wind tourbines! very huge!
- getting to know the interior of Car, very very well
