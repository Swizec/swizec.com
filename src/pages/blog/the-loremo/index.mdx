A lot of people are saying that this is a silly car, that it&#x27;s too small, too unpretty, looks cheap and what have you. But I find the[ Loremo](http://loremo.com/) to be a rather interesting little car. Of course it&#x27;s not what you normally see on the road and it&#x27;s far from being aesthetically pleasing to those who only like the sporty look, but that&#x27;s alright, it wasn&#x27;t meant to be that, it&#x27;s meant to be an efficient little futuristic vehicle.
