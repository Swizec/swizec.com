At [this week&#x27;s livecoding session](https://swizec.com/blog/livecoding-39-towards-ai-writes-javascript/swizec/7621), I mentioned mutating ASTs to improve the performance of our [faux AI that writes JavaScript](https://github.com/Swizec/faux-js-ai) algorithm. It would help us converge on a solution faster.



But what is an AST?



Well, it&#x27;s an abstract syntax tree. It&#x27;s that thing computers use to understand your code. Let me explain how they work. I think every programmer can benefit from knowing this stuff.



It took my compilers professor in college a few hours. Let&#x27;s see if I can show you the gist of it in a few hundred words. With a picture or two.



We&#x27;re going to use [Babylon](https://github.com/babel/babylon) to parse code into an AST and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to print it back out into code. Coincidentally, that&#x27;s how Prettier approaches making your code pretty. You&#x27;ll see that too.



We begin with a test harness runnable in node.js.



```javascript
const util = require("util");
const babylon = require("babylon");

const code = `
`;

let AST = babylon.parse(code);

console.log(util.inspect(AST, false, null));
```



We&#x27;re going to put the code we&#x27;re testing into `code`. The rest is there to parse it and print the resulting AST. `babylon.parse` is where the magic happens.



Parsing an empty piece of code creates an AST like this:



```javascript
Node {
  type: 'File',
  start: 0,
  end: 1,
  loc: 
   SourceLocation {
     start: Position { line: 1, column: 0 },
     end: Position { line: 2, column: 0 } },
  program: 
   Node {
     type: 'Program',
     start: 0,
     end: 1,
     loc: 
      SourceLocation {
        start: Position { line: 1, column: 0 },
        end: Position { line: 2, column: 0 } },
     sourceType: 'script',
     body: [],
     directives: [] },
  comments: [],
  tokens: 
   [ Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: 'eof',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: false,
          startsExpr: false,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: undefined,
       start: 1,
       end: 1,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation {
          start: Position { line: 2, column: 0 },
          end: Position { line: 2, column: 0 } } } ] }
```



That doesn&#x27;t tell you much, does it? It doesn&#x27;t tell me anything. Most of it is for Babylon to know what&#x27;s going on.



Here&#x27;s the part we care about:



```javascript
  program: 
   Node {
     type: 'Program',
     start: 0,
     end: 1,
     loc: 
      SourceLocation {
        start: Position { line: 1, column: 0 },
        end: Position { line: 2, column: 0 } },
     sourceType: 'script',
     body: [],
     directives: [] },
```



You can read this as _&quot;There is a program that starts at 0:1 and ends at 0:2 and has an empty body. It is a script.&quot;_. That means our code isn&#x27;t as empty as we thought; it&#x27;s got a whole empty line!



In a picture, that AST looks something like this:



![](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2017-06-fileprogram1.jpg)



Root `file` node, child `program` node.



Now let&#x27;s try a variable assignment.



```javascript
const code = `
let a = 5;
`;
```



That outputs a bigger AST. I&#x27;m going to snip out some of the details to make this readable.



```javascript
program: 
   Node {
     type: 'Program',
     start: 0,
     end: 12,
     loc: 
      SourceLocation {},
     sourceType: 'script',
     body: 
      [ Node {
          type: 'VariableDeclaration',
          start: 1,
          end: 11,
          loc: 
           SourceLocation {},
          declarations: 
           [ Node {
               type: 'VariableDeclarator',
               start: 5,
               end: 10,
               loc: 
                SourceLocation {},
               id: 
                Node {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  start: 5,
                  end: 6,
                  loc: 
                   SourceLocation {},
                  name: 'a' },
               init: 
                Node {
                  type: 'NumericLiteral',
                  start: 9,
                  end: 10,
                  loc: 
                   SourceLocation {},
                  extra: { rawValue: 5, raw: '5' },
                  value: 5 } } ],
          kind: 'let' } ],
     directives: [] },
```



Our body now has a `variableDeclaration` node, which contains a `variableDeclarator` with an `Identifier` and a `NumericLiteral`. From this AST, you can infer that a `variableDeclarator` can contain multiple declarators, and that each declarator has an `id` and an `init`. The `id` node identifies the resulting variable and `init` sets its value.



In a picture, that looks something like this:



![](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2017-06-image2.jpg)



You&#x27;ll notice the AST doesn&#x27;t talk much about what our code says. There&#x27;s no lets and equal signs or any of that. Sure, the identifier has a `name` and the init has a `value`, but the rest is an abstraction level higher.



An AST talks about what the code does, not what it is.



There&#x27;s a list of tokens if you want to know what the code says:



```javascript
tokens: 
   [ Token {
       type: 
        KeywordTokenType {
          label: 'let',
          keyword: 'let',
          beforeExpr: false,
          startsExpr: false,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: 'let',
       start: 1,
       end: 4,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation {},
     Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: 'name',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: false,
          startsExpr: true,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: [Function] },
       value: 'a',
       start: 5,
       end: 6,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation {},
     Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: '=',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: true,
          startsExpr: false,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: true,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: '=',
       start: 7,
       end: 8,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation { },
     Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: 'num',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: false,
          startsExpr: true,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: 5,
       start: 9,
       end: 10,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation {},
     Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: ';',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: true,
          startsExpr: false,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: undefined,
       start: 10,
       end: 11,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation {},
     Token {
       type: 
        TokenType {
          label: 'eof',
          keyword: undefined,
          beforeExpr: false,
          startsExpr: false,
          rightAssociative: false,
          isLoop: false,
          isAssign: false,
          prefix: false,
          postfix: false,
          binop: null,
          updateContext: null },
       value: undefined,
       start: 12,
       end: 12,
       loc: 
        SourceLocation { } ]
```



The list of tokens is a lot more interesting to Babylon than it is to you or I. It explains how to translate your code into a syntax tree.



For example, let&#x27;s say our parser encounters the `a` token. Just like you, it recognizes that this is not a JavaScript reserved word. That must mean it&#x27;s a name for something and it starts a new expression.



```javascript
Token {
   type: 
    TokenType {
      label: 'name',
      keyword: undefined,
      beforeExpr: false,
      startsExpr: true,
      rightAssociative: false,
      isLoop: false,
      isAssign: false,
      prefix: false,
      postfix: false,
      binop: null,
      updateContext: [Function] },
   value: 'a',
   start: 5,
   end: 6
}
```



The parser keeps going. It doesn&#x27;t know yet what this new expression is going to be, but its name is `a`.



So it finds the `=` sign.



```javascript
type: 
TokenType {
  label: '=',
  keyword: undefined,
  beforeExpr: true,
  startsExpr: false,
  rightAssociative: false,
  isLoop: false,
  isAssign: true,
  prefix: false,
  postfix: false,
  binop: null,
  updateContext: null },
value: '=',
```



Ah, so we&#x27;re doing assignment, `isAssign`, and we&#x27;re expecting an expression afterwards. At least that&#x27;s what I think `beforeExpr` means. It&#x27;s hard to know for sure because `;` also gets the `beforeExpr` flag ðŸ¤”



Either way, Babylon then encounters a `num` token, which also starts a new expression. In this case, an expression that&#x27;s the length of a single token, but still a new expression.



As the parser goes through these tokens, it builds a syntax tree. Some tokens build new branches; others add more children to existing nodes.



Making this work is tricky. I remember building a compiler at school, and it nearly broke my brain. The hard part is that you&#x27;re reading a flat stream of tokens and converting it into a rich tree.



And yet, you do it every day when reading other people&#x27;s code! Quite impressive.



Now, once you have an AST, you can use something like Prettier to print it back out into readable code.



```javascript
const code = `
let

a
         =

 5;
`;

console.log(prettier.format(code));

// let a = 5;
```



I couldn&#x27;t find the internal Prettier function that takes an AST and outputs it, but that&#x27;s what `.format` does internally. Parses your code, prints it back out with less cruft.



When I have some time, I&#x27;ll figure out how to manipulate those ASTs to create different code.



Now excuse me while I install Prettier in my editor. ðŸ¤“
