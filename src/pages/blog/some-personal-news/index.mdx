Almost 10 years ago I came to Silicon Valley because _"if you want to build unicorns, you have to be where the unicorns are"_. That means if you see a unicorn, you gotta jump on it.

After a wonderful 4 year ride at Tia that included [the biggest women-led series B ever](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-rewrite-your-app-while-growing-to-a-dollar100000000-series-b/) and even a splash on that famous Nasdaq screen, I start a new gig on Monday. Exciting, a little scary, no idea what I'm walking into.

Below is more on where I'm going, why, and what the process looked like in this tough market.

## Where I'm going

After digging deep I decided that I have at least one more startup startup in me. Meaning a company that's hockeysticking, messy, and not at all figured out yet. Where the big challenge is building the company, not just writing the code.

Like I said [in a recent talk](https://swizec.com/blog/scaling-fast-my-talk-on-lessons-from-tech-startups/) ‚Äì¬†coding is the easy part.

I'm joining [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com) to build the web-based UX for their gene sequencing product. The deep tech they've built blows my mind and I'll be one of the dumbest people in a room full of PhD's and postdocs. ‚úåÔ∏è

## Why quit a job you love

Four years ago I wrote [what if engineers were paid like athletes](https://swizec.com/blog/what-if-engineers-were-paid-like-athletes/) and that's how I think about it. You sign a contract for 4 years, the typical vesting period, set goals you want to achieve, and get to work.

My goals when joining Tia were:

- rebuild patient UX in React + TypeScript ‚úÖ
- get to Series C ‚úÖ
- learn how things change when the engineering team grows into an engineering org ‚úÖ
- verify my weird ideas about software design work in practice ‚úÖ
- learn how to hold and nurture a long-term technical vision ‚úÖ

All that has been achieved. It's time to move on. Like Reid Hoffman, founder of linkedin, likes to say: [You join for a tour of duty and then you move on](https://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact).

### When to quit

When you start to feel like your tour of duty is done and a unicorn runs by, you gotta hop on. Screw being comfortable, _let's go_.

I say unicorn because Plasmidsaurus's growth trajectory _is insane_. Numbers I've never heard of before. And not just users! Cold hard revenue!

And yes in terms of "paid like an athlete", the package is nice. Around $1.6mil over 4 years at current valuations üòõ

My main clue it's time was when coworkers started saying they love the job because it's comfortable, not because it fuels their big ambitions.

## What's it like out there in the market

The market feels tougher than it used to, but it is thawing. Recruiter outreach in my inbox has picked up in the past 2 or 3 months and even my salary negotiation friend says he's starting to feel busy again.

If you've been waiting for the market to turn, now's a good time to start looking.

My search was casual-ish. I focused on interesting opportunities that landed in my inbox and didn't try to search job boards or apply anywhere through the front door. That's a super tough filter to get through.

When an opportunity looked interesting I replied to the email, had a recruiter screen, then they'd connect me with a company or two, and there were more screens and interviews. Everyone I talked to had a pretty standard process that amounts to a few hours of interviews with several people in the company.

All in all I spent around 40 hours on all this, talked to ~6 companies, and got 2 offers. The rest didn't feel like a fit and we kinda rejected each other.

I now have tips on interviewing as a senior. But that's an email for another day :)

Cheers,<br/>
