To make a good goulash, you need patience, love, and onions. Last night, I made the best goulash of my life.

If you've cooked goulash before, these characteristics will mean something to you: it is thick, but requires no flour; it is sweet, but requires no sugar. üôèüèª

If you've never cooked such a thing‚Ä¶ trust me that it is difficult. It almost never works out. The patience doesn't combine with the onions well enough, the tomatoes overpower the natural sweetness and make it sour. Things go slightly wrong.

My goulash is not a real goulash. You can think of it as a goulash-inspired sauce.

Real goulash has potatoes and works as its own dish. Like a delicious, thick, filling soup.

Mine is meant to go accompany a carb. You can put it on polenta (a Slovenian favorite), or pasta. Rice would be weird. Potatoes‚Ä¶ if you're gonna use potatoes, just make a real goulash, eh?

## Here's what you'll need:

- onions
- chopped up cow, "stew chunks" are best
- carrots
- diced tomatoes from a can
- tomato paste
- paprika powder (mine was "smoked")
- bay leaves
- thyme
- parsley
- tarragon
- salt
- vegetable oil

### Equipment:

- big pot
- a lid that matches your pot
- a stirring device (big wooden spoon recommended)
- a plate
- a kitchen knife
- a wooden kitchen cutting board
- a chopper (not necessary but makes life easier)
- a stove
- some countertop space
- 1 hour of active time
- 1 hour of cooking time with interruptions

## Here's how you do it:

Salt and cook the beef with tarragon till it turns white and add it to the onions cooked in the same pot. Cook till the onion-beef mixture is uniform and then add the remaining ingredients.

Cook this mixture until it forms a delicious goulash.

Your goulash is now done. Taste it. Is it not delicious?

Take the pot off the stove. Let it sit overnight. Reheat before eating. Reheating makes goulash better.
