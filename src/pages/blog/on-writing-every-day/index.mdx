![Stephen King](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/11193169_gal7.jpg "Stephen King")

1.  Many people tweet about 20 times a day - that's roughly 140 words right there. Enough for a daily tumblr blogpost thing
2.  Those using facebook probably write about 5 status updates a day - 50 words right there?
3.  And you probably write email as well. This gives you at least 300 words a day.
4.  Hang out on skype or IRC? Doubtlessly at least 200 words a day right there as well.

If you want also to show anyone what you've written, I suggest giving [On Writing, by Stephen King](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439156816/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ageewitahat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1439156816) a read. Awesome book that will fix up your style in no time. Really helped iron out all the "look at me, I'm a writer and this is _significant_" bullshit out of the way I write.
