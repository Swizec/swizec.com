[Barcamp Ljubljana](http://www.barcamp.si/) happened yesterday and if you don&#x27;t know what a barcamp is don&#x27;t go looking for explanations in this post. I still can&#x27;t explain what a barcamp is, it&#x27;s just one of those difficult to epxlain things, like twitter or open source,but I can vouch for them being EXTREMELY fun. No Saturday before had ever flown by so quickly. So yes, I am extremely pleased that I went.

We started off in the morning, me wisely coming much earlier than I usually would to something like this (in the words of one Henry Wotton, &quot;I don&#x27;t have time to be punctual&quot;) because I wanted to have a presentation and I&#x27;ve read that the earlier you get there the more slots are left for you to pick from. So I picked a spot at a lovely time in a lovably small classroom ... but they later on moved me into the big lecture hall sine I apparently piqued a lot of people&#x27;s interests. Err thanks guys, I was totally unprepared, a complete newbie never having given a public presentation before and you go and move me to the big lecture hall. Brilliant.

Anyhow, all the talks I was to were quite awesome. Must say I found Andraz Tori&#x27;s introduction into gaining investments for an idea especially intriguing and I think everyone there really got a lot from the whole thing. The other pearl amongst talks was somebody&#x27;s talk, sorry I forgot the name of the very cool guy, on data mining. He should work as an actor, it was magnificent to watch.

The best thing about barcamps, judging from yesterday&#x27;s, is that so many great people were there and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever before gotten to know so many new people in a single day. Especially at the party afterwards, wow, hope I didn&#x27;t make an arse of myself though &#x27;cause the last thing I remember was talking to [@gandalfar](http://twitter.com/gandalfar) about ... err what were we talking about again ... oh well. I&#x27;m sure the important bits will come to me eventually.

Can&#x27;t wait to go to another barcamp.
