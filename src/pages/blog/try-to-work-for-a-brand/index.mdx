Here's a career tip many engineers don't think of:

When your company (or client) uses brand as a strategy, that helps _you_. Because a human is going to read your resume and [your resume is a marketing asset](https://thenewstack.io/what-it-takes-to-become-a-senior-engineer/).

Brands are pernicious little things. They weasel into your brain unnoticed.

When a credit card logo shows up on a tip tray, you give a bigger tip. Even seeing a credit card logo somewhere in the room makes you spend more. [No really](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap143213.pdf). The effect is reversed if you've been in serious credit card debt before.

Even as an interviewer I've noticed that recognizing a past company on your resume makes me go _"Oh hey that's cool! I've heard of them before!"_. And it changes the feel of the first 3 minutes together. You get a reputation bump.

That's why I no longer look at resumes for on-site interviews. Focus on the task at hand. No bias. ðŸ˜‡

But the initial phone screen that gets you to an on-site? That's all about [what you've done in the past and how](https://swizec.com/blog/what-to-expect-in-senior-level-interviews/). Brand helps.

I wanted to include a counter-example but I can't think of any.

A world of companies using direct sales and networking as a strategy ... but if you're not the target customer, you'll never know they're there.
