That&#x27;s right, swizec is writing yet another blog about boobs. I seem to write a lot of these, at least one a year and if I was less of a lazy bastard I&#x27;d actually take this opportunity to link to the lot, but I _am_ a lazy bastard and won&#x27;t do it. But let&#x27;s explore the range of my vocabulary and attempt to use every term for breasts only once.

So let&#x27;s begin ... what was I thinking about the other day ... something about chest ... Ah that&#x27;s right. My mind was contemplating the interesting fact about which gender gives more importance to these lumps of flesh bestowed upon women and the more I thought about it the more it was painfully obvious that it&#x27;s women.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not that men don&#x27;t love a good pair of jugs, it&#x27;s just that for us they&#x27;re more of an appendage, an added bonus if you will, to the whole package. They&#x27;re a fun toy and a soothing place to rest one&#x27;s eyes upon, also very awesome for use as pillows, forearm exercise devices, physics studying apparatus, but that&#x27;s all they are. We like the woman for the woman not for her knockers.

Women on the other hand, seem to base a lot of their self-worth on the shape, size, firmness, perkiness and whathaveyou of their baby-feeders. They also judge other women based on it and, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, hold long discussions over them. It&#x27;s weird. There&#x27;s even women out there who get their blubber bags enlarged simply because they think men will like them more if they do. You&#x27;re wrong, we won&#x27;t, but you might.

So in conclusion, to men, it&#x27;s the whole package that matters and titties are just a part of it, whereas to women it&#x27;s, apparently, the tits that matter.
