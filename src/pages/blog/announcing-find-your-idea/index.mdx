Derek Sivers once said that [ideas are just multipliers](https://sivers.org/multiply). Start with a bad idea and you're gonna fail. Start with a great idea and with some luck and hard work, you're gonna crush it.

> AWFUL IDEA = -1  
> WEAK IDEA = 1  
> SO-SO IDEA = 5  
> GOOD IDEA = 10  
> GREAT IDEA = 15  
> BRILLIANT IDEA = 20

> NO EXECUTION = $1  
> WEAK EXECUTION = $1000  
> SO-SO EXECUTION = $10,000  
> GOOD EXECUTION = $100,000  
> GREAT EXECUTION = $1,000,000  
> BRILLIANT EXECUTION = $10,000,000  
> **To make a business, you need to multiply the two.**

Derek Sivers was right {% if subscriber.first_name != blank %} {{ subscriber.first_name | truncatewords: 1, "" | capitalize }} {% else %} my friend {% endif %}. You need a good idea for your hard work to be worth it.

Imagine pouring brilliant execution into a terrible idea üëâ minus $10,000,000. Yikes üò¨

We talked about that yesterday.

Frederic Tudor started with a _horrible_ idea ‚Äì nobody wanted ice in the tropics. They didn't even know what to use it for. But he developed that initial hunch into a _fantastic_ idea.

30 years later **everyone wanted ice**. He made a killing, created a whole new industry, and died a wealthy man.

So how do you know, if your idea is any good {{ subscriber.first_name | truncatewords: 1, "" | capitalize }}? How do you know whether it's a dud or a slow hunch that just needs some love? Hell, how do you get over the \_"I don't have an idea"\_ hump in the first place?

## Find Your Idea

[![](./img/HQpmAbo.png)](https://gum.co/fKfYf)

[Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) is a short online workshop that teaches you how to source, classify, and validate your ideas _before_ you jump in and waste your time.

Worried you don't have ideas? [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) teaches you how to spot tens of ideas per week.

Worried you don't have _good_ ideas? [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) gives you a quick mental checklist.

Worried you'll waste your time? [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) shows you the framework I use to validate and stair-step ideas from investing 5 minutes to verify a hunch all the way to seeing if anyone will buy.

Don't wanna start a business? [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) helps you classify ideas into 3 buckets based on _"What's the goal of this one?"_

Join this class and learn every mental model and quick hack I developed over the past 10 years of making money online and studying the bootstrapping greats that came before me.

[Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) happens on **May 10th at 1pm Pacific** and lasts about 2 hours. Structured as a workshop this isn't just some boring lecture.

You'll do exercises, answer questions, analyze other people's ideas, and contribute your own. Walk away with a solid mental checklist that helps you qualify any idea in minutes, and a work sheet you can use to develop ideas in the future.

Can't make it live? Don't worry.

You'll get the raw recording right after. After some editing [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf) will become a self-paced video workshop.

Join now and you get access. Wait and it's 2x the price :)

So {% if subscriber.first_name != blank %} {{ subscriber.first_name | truncatewords: 1, "" | capitalize }} {% else %} my friend {% endif %}, wanna learn a structured approach to creating and developing ideas? Join [Find Your Idea](https://gum.co/fKfYf).
