Here's a painful lesson from production that brought several engineers almost to tears: *Please* add PATCH endpoints to your public APIs.

This is true for all APIs: REST, GraphQL, RPC, or sockets. You need PATCH, a way for users to *update* an object.

Here's why:

Months ago we integrated with a vendor, who will go un-named, to handle calendar events for us. They have good integrations with gCal and such, a nice API, and solve fun algorithmic problems that we don't have time to tackle.

Optimal packing of a user schedule is akin to the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), a famous NP-complete (-ish, it's complicated) problem, and ain't nobody got time to solve unsolvable problems at a startup. But this unnamed vendor has a Good Enough‚Ñ¢ solution! Perfect.

## What the heck??

We build this integration and save for [a few hiccups with daylight savings](https://swizec.com/blog/saving-time-in-utc-doesnt-work-and-offsets-arent-enough/) everything is fine.

Until spooky things started to happen. Events un-cancelling long after they were cancelled. Timezones shifting for no reason. Attendees going missing ...

ü§®

What could it be!? A distributed systems problem with updates being dropped? Wonky eventual consistency? Silent errors we don't notice? Accidentally [unresolved promises](https://swizec.com/blog/finding-unresolved-promises-in-javascript/) causing issues?

Nope it was nothing fun like that. A *massive* amount of logging revealed we were overwriting our own data. Changing events to drop fields ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## No PATCH equals pain

You see this vendor has no PATCH. There is only a POST (insert) and it acts like a PUT (upsert), but that's fine, we can handle that. The lack of PATCH hurts, though.

Here's what happens:

Say you create an event on the user's calendar. Friday 1pm for an hour. You POST an object like this:

```javascript
{
	calendar_id: 1234
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1234 }
	],
	start: '2022-10-28T20:00:00.000Z'
	end: '2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z'
}
```

This adds an event to calendar `1234`, adds the user as an attendee, and sets start/end times.

How would you *update* this event to set a cancelled status?

That's right, you send the whole object again.

```javascript
{
	calendar_id: 1234
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1234 }
	],
	start: '2022-10-28T20:00:00.000Z'
	end: '2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z'
	status: 'cancelled'
}
```

What about adding another attendee? Multiple people tend to join a meeting.

That's right, you send the whole object again!

```javascript
{
	calendar_id: 1234
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1234 },
		{ user_id: 1235 }
	],
	start: '2022-10-28T20:00:00.000Z'
	end: '2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z'
}
```

Oh no look what we did! The event is no longer cancelled üò±

User `1235` didn't know the event was cancelled. Client hasn't synced yet, for example. When they joined the meeting, they didn't send the `status: 'cancelled'` field and the unnamed vendor dutifully overwrote the data.

Now user `1234` has two meetings at the same time because someone else saw a hole on their schedule and quickly booked a time to chat. Awkward ...

## How PATCH helps

Now imagine that same sequence, but with a PATCH endpoint.

First we create the event:

```javascript
{
	calendar_id: 1234
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1234 }
	],
	start: '2022-10-28T20:00:00.000Z'
	end: '2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z'
}
```

Then we send a PATCH to cancel:

```javascript
{ 
	event_id: ...,
	status: 'cancelled'
}
```

And a PATCH to add an attendee:

```javascript
{ 
	event_id: ...,
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1235 }
	]
}
```

The system merges all this data into the final object:

```javascript
{
	event_id: ...
	calendar_id: 1234
	attendees: [
		{ user_id: 1234 },
		{ user_id: 1235 }
	],
	start: '2022-10-28T20:00:00.000Z'
	end: '2022-10-28T21:00:00.000Z',
	status: 'cancelled'
}
```

PATCH, or its equivalents in other API genres, lets you *update an object* without knowing the full state. Super useful when you want the API to be the source of truth, not every client.

Without PATCH, it is easy to create a race condition where multiple clients send updates, each missing parts of state the other clients are sending. Whomever comes last, that's the new object. Not great.

Now you might ask *"Okay smartass, what about removing an attendee? How do you do that with PATCH?*

And you'd be right, that's where REST patterns get wonky. You'd need an explicit DELETE endpoint of sorts. A function that lets you say "Remove X from event Y".
