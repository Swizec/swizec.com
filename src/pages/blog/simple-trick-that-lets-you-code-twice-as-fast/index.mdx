![Basic idea from THE Bret Victor talk](http://icant.co.uk/talks/h5/pictures/smashingconf/shorterjourney.jpg "Basic idea from THE Bret Victor talk")![]()

## 1. Automated testing

**![Mocha automated automated testing](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mocha-testing.png "Mocha automated automated testing")![]()\_\_**

1.  Write some code
2.  Hop into a console of some sort
3.  Possibly compile things
4.  Run the test suite
5.  Wait while it runs
6.  Give in to the urge to quickly check twitterredditfacebooksomething
7.  Go back to coding long after the tests finished

Great, it's just taken a minute (not counting twitterredditfacebooksomething time) to find out if something works. I do this every ~5 minutes, that means a waste of 10 minutes per every hour worked.

## 2. Automated automated testing

One hour and twenty minutes every full workday. Man, that's some non-negligible time right there! Then again, I've got an automated test suite, why am I running it manually? Wouldn't it be better if something ran the test suite every time I hit _Ctrl+S_? And that's exactly how it's supposed to be! Let [automated testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation "Test automation") run automatically and just glance at the results every so often. You won't break concentration, you won't be tempted to check twitter while the tests run, you won't have to get out of your [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor"). Win-win-win. Right now I use two tools to do this (and am looking for more) [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)'s got a wonderful _-w_ option for running node.js tests - it watches files for changes and reruns the suite every time you save. And Mocha is just generally wonderful, but that's a different post. For frontend development, I'm using \_[Live CSS Mod](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-css-mod/pcfngkdgaccedbamgamojgomaibafdcg) - \_a Chrome extension, which refreshes a page every couple of seconds. But it's smart enough to do this in the background and only show the changes if there's anything different. This means you don't lose state all the time because that would be annoying. Now all I need are these sorts of tools for the other stacks I'm using. (Django/python and Haskell).
