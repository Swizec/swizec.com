Yesterday I asked what you could do with an extra $1,000/month and got a bunch of cool replies. Everything from _&quot;Give it to my wife, obviously&quot;_ to _&quot;You know that $75k average looks pretty damn good in my country ...&quot;_



You&#x27;re right, it does. Where I&#x27;m from – Slovenia – $75k means you make as much as the president.



Where I&#x27;m at now – San Francisco – the number is closer to $320k. Global averages are funny like that. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯



Today I wanted to talk about this 👇



> So... what do I need to do to make an extra $1,000/month?



Thanks Brad, great question! ❤️



## Solve a problem, my friend



Your best bet is to solve a problem. Doesn&#x27;t have to be big. It&#x27;s _better_, if the problem is small.



Like John Gall once said about systems



> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.



Same is true for business. Every good business starts by solving _one very specific_ problem.



Blue Bottle offered a good coffee roast. Google found your website. Netflix _sent_ DVDs. Amazon had every book in stock. Lyft showed how long you&#x27;ll wait. Tesla had an electric car that&#x27;s exciting. IBM processed _a_ census in weeks instead of years.



Huge now. Started small.



You don&#x27;t have to aim that high, my friend. Aiming that high is scary snd difficult no matter what Bruce Lee says.

## Aim small



Solve a small problem, my friend. Don’t worry about how big it gets. You can’t make $10,000 without first making $1,000.



Think about a time you spent $5 on an app. What was it?



I once paid $19 for an app that hides desktop icons. Because my desktop is where temporary files go to die.

The app makes me look good in public.



Or there’s an app with a $5 subscription that tracks business restaurant spending. I could just put receipts in a box.



But when I&#x27;m doing taxes, a folder of photos will be soooo much easier.



I even have an app to track my food. $9/month even tho I could use a spreadsheet. Just because the app comes with a food database and a nice form.



Hell, I once bought $10 of cable organizers just because I was tired of digging my phone charger from under the couch every day.



Tiny little annoyances. You might not even think they’re worth solving.



But they go away and it&#x27;s like a fog lifts off your day. You can breathe, my friend.

How often do _you_ get annoyed by a tiny little thing? Think others do too?



## Tiny annoyances make the best $1,000/month businesses



Here’s why



1. They’re annoying
2. Too small for the big companies to go after
3. Everyone feels them
4. The internet is a big place



Number 2 is important. _Nobody else will solve your problem_. **You** have to do it.



Then charge a small fee.



Because as Pieter Levels once said, there&#x27;s only so many ways to make a million dollars.

$1,000 is even easier.



What&#x27;s something that annoys you, my friend, that you&#x27;d pay $5 to solve. Do you think there&#x27;s 200 others in the whole wide world who&#x27;d do the same?



I think there are.



Cheers,
