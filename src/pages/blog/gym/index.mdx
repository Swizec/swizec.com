Today I finally managed going to the gym after almost a week of not being able to attend my daily sessions due to insane work hours. Since I&#x27;ve begun going this was the longest period of not going and it was quite an odd feeling. I felt weak and powerless, but at the same time didn&#x27;t get as tired as I usually do, which, in a way, is good, but maybe it just shows that I was slacking off lest I hurt myself.

I did almost manage to hurt myself when I was doing benchpresses where the left side didn&#x27;t quite go into the resting position, but I still laxed my arms. Luckily the bar was long enough so as to hit the ground before breaking my face. If I wasn&#x27;t in so much pain from lifting that thing I&#x27;d probably get very very frightened by this event.

Mentioned insane work hours didn&#x27;t I? There&#x27;s this project at work that needs immediate finishing, we only got it a week or so ago, and it required that I worked 12 hours a day on average for a few days including the weekend. If I was a proper employee this wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, but for cthulhu&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;m technically doing this as a bloody part time job!
