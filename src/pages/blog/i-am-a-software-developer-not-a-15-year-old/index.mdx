As a \_computer guy \_I often get asked to do various computer related things for people. Because obviously I work with computers all day and that means I can use every piece of software ever invented. Most of all it means I can fix any computer any time.

But I'm not 15 anymore. It's been a while since I've been able to use any piece of software I don't use frequently - sometimes I barely use 5% of what a piece of software can do (I'm looking at you Emacs) and am completely oblivious to everything else.

And yet, the requests come.

So for future reference, here is a list of things I don't know anymore:

&lt;list off a bunch of random requests peopel keep making and wear your ignorance proud>

&lt;explain that this isn't so much ignorance as it is specialisation>
