As a \_computer guy \_I often get asked to do various computer related things for people. Because obviously I work with computers all day and that means I can use every piece of software ever invented. Most of all it means I can fix any computer any time.

But I&#x27;m not 15 anymore. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been able to use any piece of software I don&#x27;t use frequently - sometimes I barely use 5% of what a piece of software can do (I&#x27;m looking at you Emacs) and am completely oblivious to everything else.

And yet, the requests come.

So for future reference, here is a list of things I don&#x27;t know anymore:

&amp;lt;list off a bunch of random requests peopel keep making and wear your ignorance proud&gt;

&amp;lt;explain that this isn&#x27;t so much ignorance as it is specialisation&gt;
