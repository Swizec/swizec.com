![Checkbox-field](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-13-at-10.43.12-PM.png "Checkbox-field")![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()

- take a select, turn it into a list of options
- every option becomes a _Checkbox_ model in a collection
- render each Checkbox as a _CheckboxView_
- connect everything with some events

What I really love about the Backbone approach is that all of this works almost magically. Instead of bending over backwards to get checkboxes and the hidden multiselect synced up, all I had to do was create some models, some views and tell them how they are connected. This is how the field itself is created

```javascript
$multiselect.find("option").each(function (i, el) {
  var $el = $(el);
  // hidden behind the scenes here is that:
  // 1. creating a Checkbox, correctly binds together all needed events
  // 2. adding it to checkboxes, takes care of rendering and adding to the DOM
  checkboxes.add(
    new Checkbox({
      value: $el.val(),
      label: $el.html(),
      selected: $el.attr("selected"),
    })
  );
});
```

And to make sure data is synced up between its three representations (multiselect, visual checkboxes, the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") itself), all it takes is this:

```javascript
var Checkbox = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function () {
    this.bind("change:selected", this.toggled);

    this.attributes.id = this.cid;
  },

  toggled: function () {
    var $opt = $multiselect.find("option[value=" + this.get("value") + "]");

    if (this.get("selected")) {
      $opt.attr("selected", "1");
    } else {
      $opt.removeAttr("selected");
    }
  },
});
```

Yep, that's the whole model and that's all it takes to sync everything up. Pretty cool huh? I remember trying to do this with just [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "JQuery") once ... I nearly stabbed my eyes out to end the misery. All in all the whole thing is just _123 sloc_, which can only mean one thing: Backbone is cool. If you use my [checkbox-field](http://swizec.github.com/checkbox-field/) library, it's only going to be a single sloc for you:

```javascript
$("#my_selector").checkboxField();
```

That's it :) Let me know what you think.
