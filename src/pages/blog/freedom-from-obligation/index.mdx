At Yosemite this weekend I met an old man and he said to me _&quot;Young man, Americans work too much&quot;_



In his 50s or 60s, beard white, face of wrinkles, and the youthfulest spark in his eye the world has ever seen. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone look quite so young before.



_&quot;Cool how you can fit all your camping gear on the bike&quot;_, he said as I walked past the bear proof trash cans.

_&quot;Thanks! It&#x27;s amazing how small they get backpacking stuff these days. Nice setup you got yourself, do you come here often?&quot;_



He was in a converted pickup truck. Full bed with a proper mattress, storage space underneath, room enough to walk around if you crouch a little. Said he sleeps better in his truck than he does at home.



Cozy like a coffin he called it.



_&quot;Yeah it sucks this year I&#x27;m in different camps every day so I have to pack up and move around. Usually I set up camp for a few weeks and I have visitors, go on hikes, chill ... I already had some visitors yesterday but it&#x27;s hard when you move so much&quot;_



Wow that sounds nice. Hard to take that much time off though ...

_&quot;Yeah, Americans they work too much. It&#x27;s all about those 3 day weekends isn&#x27;t it? And you never quite get rested.&quot;_



I nodded.



_&quot;I used to be like you. Always working, always striving, pushing for something and one day I realized even I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m striving for. So I stopped._



...



_&quot;Now I work 6 months a year as a building contractor. All word of mouth. I don&#x27;t do any advertising. My clients wait for me. They call and say hey when are you available to do so and so and I tell them sorry I&#x27;m in Bali&quot;_



You what?



_&quot;Yeah I go to Bali every year for a few months. Then I come to Yosemite. Been here at least 100 times. Some four years of staying inside Yosemite in total I calculated the other day&quot;_



Wow that sounds amazing! Kudos to you my man



_&quot;Oh it&#x27;s great. And I live in Santa Cruz which is almost as expensive as San Francisco these days. I don&#x27;t know how anyone can afford to live in SF if they don&#x27;t work in tech. It&#x27;s crazy. But yeah there&#x27;s so much demand for construction and renovation especially with all these fires ... I ain&#x27;t worried. The work will never dry up&quot;_



He&#x27;s right you know. The work will never stop.



You can rush to get everything done and tire yourself out, or you can work at a sustainable pace and enjoy life. Either way, the next task is always there for you, waiting.



I learned an important lesson that day.



Kind of reminds me of the opening anecdote in [Company of One](https://ofone.co/) by @pjrvs.
