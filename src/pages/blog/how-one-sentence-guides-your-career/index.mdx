Do you know what fires you up in the morning?

Here's the reaction you're looking for: _"Thatâ€™s weirdly specific in surprising ways"_.

Last week we talked about [how positioning makes you stand out from the crowd](https://swizec.com/blog/how-positioning-makes-you-stand-out-from-the-crowd/). Chas, a reader, replied to ask for my positioning statement as an example. Here's what I sent:

> I build consumer web products for private VC-backed companies that sell directly to users.

I tweak this based on who's asking and it's never as crisp as I'd like. But that one sentence captures my whole career since about 2010.

Chas was surprised. _"Thatâ€™s weirdly specific in surprising ways. Rather than focus on the tech you work with you specify consumer (no B2B?), private (no public?), VC-backed (the most surprising), and direct-to-users. Huh?"_

Let's break it down.

## What's in a positioning statement

A positioning statement answers _"**what** do you do for **whom**?"_. That's it. You try to say this in a way that resonates with the reader.

I learned this back in my solo consulting days and continue to use the same approach in my employee days. Because [modern tech workers think like consultants](https://swizec.com/blog/should-you-work-at-a-startup/).

My statement has 3 parts:

1. I build consumer web products
2. for private VC-backed companies
3. that sell directly to users

### I build consumer web products

Consumer web products are my jam. Tech doesn't matter.

I've been doing this since _The Way_ was a server-rendered PHP file spitting out plain HTML. Yes, even before jQuery existed. One of my earliest conference talks was about this newfangled Single Page App architecture back in 2011 â€“ months after Backbone.js launched.

Got a technical or UX challenge facing a consumer web app? Chances are I've seen and solved it before. This makes me _invaluable_ as a partner to any product manager. I'll know if your idea won't work.

[Own the outcome, not the work](https://swizec.com/blog/own-the-outcome-not-the-work/) ðŸ¤˜

### for private VC-backed companies

Different companies have different feels. Working for a government contractor hits different than working for a mom-and-pop web design agency. Your whole lifestyle changes.

I like VC-backed companies for 2 reasons:

1. They have lots of free money and aren't afraid to pay
2. They grow fast and invent new challenges regularly

That works for me. I like money and I like novelty. And **I love building things from scratch** to prove they work. Polishing an existing old project makes me bored and agency work is too much like a fart in the wind.

The "private" bit is about opportunity. I like to join [at the bottom of an S-curve](https://swizec.com/blog/when-to-join-and-leave-a-company-project-or-trend/).

### that sell directly to users

This part is about morals. I like projects where the incentives of the user and the company are aligned.

No AdTech or Crypto bullshit. If we're not growing because we're providing quantifiable value to our users, I don't want it. None of this "capture eyeballs" and "sell their data later" crap.

Users pay company, company provides service. It's slower but it's fair.

## Your career needs a vision

As Richard Hamming once said, [Your career needs a vision](https://swizec.com/blog/your-career-needs-a-vision/). Otherwise you'll never get where you wanna go.

Figuring out your positioning and career vision is one of the key outcomes you can expect from the [Senior Mindset Retreat](https://focusretreatcenter.com/2023/senior-engineer-mindset/). If that sounds interesting, [you should apply](https://swizecteller.typeform.com/to/FVlJn7Qw?typeform-source=focusretreatcenter.com).

And if not, I hope you think about it. What's your vision?

Cheers,
