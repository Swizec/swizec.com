So as it turns out I&#x27;m such an idiot as to forget to mention why exactly I was an idiot in the first place when [previously talking about idiocy](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=news/id=339) . What I was going to mention was why exactly it is that Lestat took so long to get fixed up and why he wasn&#x27;t working in the first place. As it turns out processors have separate power connectors these days and I quite simply didn&#x27;t connect it and thus ... problems.

But let&#x27;s put all of that aside for now, I&#x27;m here to talk about how sexy linux has become, well it&#x27;s been sexy before but I&#x27;ve never quite tapped into the vast expense of sexiness available to me for one reason or another. Of course I&#x27;ve mentioned some of this before, but this time there&#x27;s a video and with window decorations all fixed up and sexy as well.

You might notice that there&#x27;s still a bunch of other plugins I could have enabled, shown even, but I didn&#x27;t because I either don&#x27;t know about them or was, for the time being, too dazzled by all of this as it was to think of even more sexy things to find.

Somewhere at around 2:32 in the video you might notice me adding a cup of tea on the desktop. That&#x27;s my [Tea Cooker plasmoid](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Tea+Cooker?content=85564) I was talking about making. So far it&#x27;s had a night&#x27;s worth of development put in and me basically learning everything I did along the way ... SVG graphics, by the by, are bloody awesome things. It&#x27;s not very useful yet but it&#x27;s had 23 downloads in what is essentially a single day. That&#x27;s surprisingly plenty for something that doesn&#x27;t even half work yet (can&#x27;t quite stop/start/reset the timer yet) and I _do_ intend on making it a lot better, but am having some trouble with libraries and such so I&#x27;m waiting for the final release of kde4.1 in hopes it solves my problems.
