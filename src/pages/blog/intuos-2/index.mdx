[![Intuos3](/includes/editor_upload/Image/precious_t.jpg "Intuos3")](http://swizec.com/includes/editor_upload/Image/precious.jpg)[![First tablet](/includes/editor_upload/Image/tablet_1_t.png "First tablet")](http://swizec.com/includes/editor_upload/Image/tablet_1.png)

Today I&#x27;ve bought a new Wacom Intuos3 simply for the reason that I&#x27;ve wanted a pen tablet for quite a while now and that since I don&#x27;t have enough money to buy what it was originally meant to buy it was just sitting there doing nothing, might as well spend it on something.

So far I&#x27;ve only created one image with it and after the initial trouble of getting used to it, and probably I&#x27;ll get used to it even more, it was quite fascinating to use. It is much different from using a mouse and only time will tell how quicker and easier the comics will be produced now.
