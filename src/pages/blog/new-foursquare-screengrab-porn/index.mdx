Today [Foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com/ "Foursquare") released a completely revamped version of their iPhone app.

And it's _awesome_. If you're on Android you can only hope yours gets updated soon. The whole interface is just more pleasant to use, there are less buttons - less buttons is always good, even though I'm a geek - everything is less cramped and there is a bigger emphasis on useful info rather than friends.

The explore feature has now become genuinely useful as well - love it.
