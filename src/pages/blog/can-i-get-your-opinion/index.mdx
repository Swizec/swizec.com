All great things start with a malleable prototype. Software has the minimum product/feature, Pixar movies have the storyboard, and books have the detailed outline. That's where you come in :)

A detailed outline is meant to be flexible.

You put thoughts on paper to see how they feel. Are they coming in the right order? Does this thought belong in this section or that other section over there? Does any of this even make sense. Do you have a point you're making?

No word-smithing. Zero polish. Making your thoughts real helps you iterate. Like [kicking a can](https://swizec.com/blog/writing-software-is-like-kicking-a-can/). Changes at this stage should be cheap and effortless.

Once you can't think of new changes to make, you have to ask potential readers if the outline resonates. That's you.

Please read this and tell me what you think. Absolutely anything you say is valid. Don't hold back.

If it resonates, tell me what stands out. If it sucks, tell me where. If it feels wrong, I'd love to know. If it goes against your worldview, please say more.

    - partner with product
    - engineers input, product decides
    - collaborate early
  - fix roadmap to solve engineering issues
    - ultimate vision too big a story
    - deliver value early
    - make steps estimatable
    - INVEST
  - feature flags to ship safely
    - FF ships first
    - now you can keep shipping
    - phased rollout
    - get user feedback early
    - measure everything
    - at scale there are no cutovers
- Scaling the tech
  - it’s okay to just do the work
    - don’t overthink the work, just get it done
      - small N is quicker by hand
      - rare changes can be hardcoded
      - is there even a standard process?
    - first do it manually
    - then document
    - then automate
  - let it break
    - scale breaks things in weird ways
    - the system will tell you where it hurts
    - take care of the obvious basics
  - let small fires burn
    - you can’t fix everything
    - fix the important things
    - if nobody’s complaining, it’s not a bug
    - if you can’t measure its impact, does it matter
  - you do have time to build it twice
    - everything worth doing is worth doing poorly
    - growth means more resources later
    - you don’t yet know what you need
    - BUFD doesn’t work in a vacuum

    - you can’t avoid mistakes
    - faster to ship means faster to fix
    - hide behind feature flags
    - small changes are easy to validate
    - get feedback early
  - software only moves forward
    - data lives forever
    - there are no cut-overs
      - at scale intermediary states are always
      - make this a core part of your strategy
    - different versions have to work in parallel
    - build just what you’re about to need
  - focus on architectural complexity
    - hyrum’s law
    - reduce interdependencies
    - have one source of truth
      - repeat the logic
      - don’t repeat the data
    - keep code colocated
    - build more libraries
      - avoid leaking feature-specific code into utils

    - use dependency graphs
      - identify natural modules
      - find hidden utils
    - independent pieces are easier to move
    - independent pieces are easier to change
    - you can’t fix the wrong abstraction

    - avoid solving abstract problems
    - do not generalize until a pattern develops
      - think gardening instead of planning
      - curate what people do already
      - make your patterns feel natural
    - if people don’t use your abstraction, it’s wrong
    - SOC beats DRY

      - separation of concerns matters more
      - incorrect DRY leads to tangled codebases
      - incorrect SOC is easy to fix
    - write code you’ll be smart enough to fix
  - not all tests are useful
    - types cover basic trouble
    - mocks make tests brittle
    - avoid tests for testing’s sake
    - tests make code harder to change
    - focus on the critical details
    - observe production
  - at scale flaky tests happen to real users every day
    - observability beats testing
    - only production is like production

Thanks. Enjoy your weekend.
