\[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;]![My elementary school](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/0H71ZANRNWT3G7eWWJId "My elementary school") My elementary school\[/caption] _&quot;What is a square?&quot;_, my maths teacher would ask. _&quot;A square has four equal sides at right angles and its surface area is a\*a&quot;_, a pupil would answer. Happy they got all the facts right. _&quot;But what **is** a square? Those are just its properties.&quot;_ _&quot;Errr ... a square is a ... shape? ... that has four equal sides at right angles?&quot;_ _&quot;That&#x27;s right. A square is a shape, the rest are just properties.&quot;_ Every single one of us got that wrong. Every single time. Didn&#x27;t matter if you were a straight A pupil or barely scraping by, everyone forgot to _answer the question_. The story repeated itself a year later with geometric objects. If there&#x27;s one \\important lesson about writing I ever learned, it&#x27;s that _a square is a shape_.
