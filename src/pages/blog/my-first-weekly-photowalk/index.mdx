Today I went on my first photowalk, an activity I promised myself I&#x27;d henceforth partake in at least once a week. First time I came into contact with photowalking was in some retweets by people on twitter that were talking about [photowalklist.com](http://www.photowalklist.com/) and after observing for a while it touched something within me - the photographer I used to be quite some years ago (got my first proper camera at about 4 and then continued dabbling until about 15).

Taking night-time photography of Ljubljana covered in the first snow of 2008 was bloody wonderful, sure I found out I need a tripod, yes I&#x27;m displeased with most of hte photos because they&#x27;re too bright and of course my fingers damn well nearly fell off. But that&#x27;s what photowalking is about, finding out how much you suck so you can improve.

I will be making a photowalk post every week from now on and will include a lovely widget from [Fotonauts](http://www.fotonauts.com/) - a photography sharing website/app that I&#x27;m helping beta test.
