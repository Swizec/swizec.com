The past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been living my life at 25 minute increments.

It&#x27;s a new [productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity") hack I&#x27;ve been trying out ... you&#x27;ve probably heard of it - pomodoro? The idea is that you should make an effort for absolute focus when you&#x27;re working. That means no twitter, no browsing random websites, just take a task, focus on it 100% and plow right through until you&#x27;re done. Obviously you can&#x27;t do this for 8 hours a day unless you&#x27;re some sort of robot. Most people aren&#x27;t robots. Yet. _tl;dr --&gt; Pomodoro is great for productivity, bad for Klout scores_ Therefore pomodoro demands that you take a short break every 25 minutes, and a longer one every two hours. Apparently this is just enough to keep your brain fresh for plowing through tasks like a boss and _getting shit done_. I have to say I was a bit skeptical of the whole premise. I can&#x27;t work like that! I have a scatterbrain&#x27;s mind. My mind thinks in parallels rather than linearly. The internet has ruined my ability to focus! I don&#x27;t have 25 minutes of [attention span](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span "Attention span"), are you fucking kidding me? But then I got busy. Workloads started piling up and my scattered approach just wasn&#x27;t working anymore. Even though it tends to work pretty well when you only have a project or two going on, it tended to fall apart when I had five projects I was working on in parallel. Thoughts started overflowing and my mind was just overloaded.

So I started trying out setting limits for myself. Rather than saying &quot;I will work on this until it gets done, then I will work on that other thing&quot; I just set up timeslots. Two hours for this, then no matter whether it&#x27;s done or not, the other thing for two hours. And so on ad infinitum. It worked pretty well, but I could notice myself getting burned out. Holding sufficient levels of focus for two hours is _hard_. Then I remembered this so called [Pomodoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "Pomodoro Technique") technique @gandalfar mentioned in passing one day. It seemed an awful lot like what I was doing was some sort of pomodoro anyway. Next step was to download a loud ticking pomodoro clock for my iPhone and start trying it out. It felt weird as hell! But I noticed a couple of things:

1. The loud ticking acts as a milfy hot angry grade school teacher, tapping her ruler and looking at you going &quot;Get to work maggot! Stop staring at my rack! WORK!&quot;
2. Taking short breaks when you&#x27;re in the flow is surprisingly hard
3. The scheduled long breaks are pure _awesome_
4. Forcing yourself to take a break pays dividends at 2am when you&#x27;re still fresh as a rose and able to focus

At this point I would like to admit that I sometimes don&#x27;t follow the ticking tomato as rigorously as I should. I often skip the short break because I&#x27;m on the verge of getting something done, and sometimes I take a break a couple of minutes early because I had just plowed through two pomodoro&#x27;s without taking a break. Also, the last pomodoro in a batch is usually starting to get a bit haywire and isn&#x27;t absolutely focused. However, despite all my flaws in following the technique, the past couple of weeks have been particularly good to me productivity-wise. I have:

- finished two pretty large school projects with fantastic grades
- passed several exams with decent enough grades
- started and launched [GithubFriends](http://githubfriends.swizec.com)
- watched 132 episodes of How I Met Your Mother
- had the most fruitful freelancing month ever
- had an actual social life all throughout

Although, all the focus during pomodoros has had one very awful side-effect. My Klout score is experiencing massive drops: \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; caption=&quot;Fluctuating like a boss&quot;]![](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2011-06-jLW0g4.png "Fluctuating like a boss")\[/caption]
