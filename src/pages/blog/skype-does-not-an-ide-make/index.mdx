[![Skype not an IDE](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-3.42.28-PM.png "Skype not an IDE")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-3.42.28-PM.png) This is the screen I've been staring into for most of the day. It's horrible. No way for a man to [code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code"). Or a woman. Or anyone really. If I had a child, this would be how I ground them - restrict [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") access to [Skype](http://skype.com "Skype"). Why was I doing this all day you ask? A few days ago I decided to launch a small experiment - for this I needed a small icon. [@ponywithhiccups](https://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) bravely stepped up to the task and got to work. After some days of back and forth we came up with a design both can be happy with. Bit of advice: _meet up in person_ if at all possible. Especially for design. Then I asked her to code it all up in [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") and [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"). You know, because I'm lazy and she can totally handle that and I have far less important things to do than implementing my own experiments. With a huff and a puff she got to work. Everything was going _so well._ Right up to the point she finally decided she has no idea what's going on and I should step in to help. Via Skype. Very well then, how hard can it be to lend a helping hand in coding some CSS? CSS is, like, totally child's play. I can write CSS in my sleep! Turns out, via Skype, not so much.
