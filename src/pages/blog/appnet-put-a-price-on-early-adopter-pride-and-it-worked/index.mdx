## app.net

And that's exactly what [app.net](http://app.net) cashed in on. They gave everyone the opportunity to _buy_ an account. To buy a username and be granted forever more the rights granted by the title of _Early Adopter_ - passed on by heritage on the mother's side. Forever known as those guys who were first to the party, who _knew_ the service was going to be big. They were so confident in fact that they even put their money where their mouth is. And that's amazing. Hat's off to [Dalton](http://twitter.com/daltonc) and his team. They managed to put a price on that most intangible of feelings - the pride of being an early adopter. The enthusiasm of being a part of the story. I almost signed up as well. The moment they announced having reached the funding goal; I went through all the steps for making an account. I cover myself in shame for not believing in this idea sooner. But when it came to _"Hey, give us \\\$50 per year"_. I said to myself, fuck that. You know what, this great feeling isn't worth it. I'd rather go buy some drugs instead. It amounts to the same - pay for a service that makes you feel great, maybe, or pay for some chemicals that will make you feel great, definitely. Are all those people getting anything else for their money? No. So here's an idea for the next app.net, and there _will_ be a next app.net, people love taking money from suckersusers. Sell an account for \\\$100 a year (or whatever), but the first 1000 users also get 0.001% equity. They're pretty much founders/investors anyway, why not reward them as such?
