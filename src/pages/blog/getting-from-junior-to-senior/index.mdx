The difference in salary between a junior and senior engineer can be orders of magnitude. Many multiples at least. But what's the difference in mindset that gets you there?

I explored that question on two podcast episodes recently.

## Scrimba â€“Â Advice from a Senior Silicon Valley Engineer

On [The Scrimba Podcast with Alex](https://scrimba.com/podcast/junior-developer-advice-from-a-senior-silicon-valley-engineer/), we talked about what companies look for in junior engineers, how to get hired and grow fast, and I mentioned the most impressive thing I ever saw from a candidate.

The Google topic is conjecture on my part. Based on what I've seen and heard from folks working in large enterprises. You hire a bunch of juniors, give them all the tools they need to succeed, and see who makes it. Trial by fire.

Google is better than places like McKinsey and law firms, though. Those have an explicit "up or out" policy ðŸ˜¬

## Ruined by a Software Engineer

On [Perry's Podcast Ruined by a Software Engineer with Swizec](https://perrytiu.com/podcast/#27), we talked about the mindset of a senior software engineer, serverless computing, why people love-hate JavaScript, and how to approach writing a book.

Best part of chatting with Perry is that we met up in person. Feels so much more eventful than yet another zoom call ðŸ˜‡

Interesting insight about getting into coding â€“Â I didn't realize until well into my 20's that programming words mean things in real life. To me a sort was just some specific thing computers do.
