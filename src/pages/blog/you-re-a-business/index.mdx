If you treat your job like it’s a/your business, _people love that_.

Your autonomy grows, your responsibility grows, you get to set strategy, etc. All the good stuff with way less of the bad stuff – because somebody else deals with that.

You go from “Do this task” to “Reach this goal” to “Find what we need and make it happen”

It’s honestly pretty sweet.
