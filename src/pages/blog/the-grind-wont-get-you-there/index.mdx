I saw a great quote about [The Quiet Ones](https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/the-quiet-ones) yesterday: _â€ŒBy the time they ask for recognition, they're already gone. The ask isn't a request. It's a test you've already failed._

The best engineers go for the cracks in the system. They find what isn't working and fix it. Take on the conversations nobody's having. Ask the questions people aren't asking. Build features that customers need but don't think to request. Create frameworks where others copypaste. Make tools where others schlep.

These folks are hard to promote and difficult to notice. They keep the system running and don't fit a particular mold or set of OKRs.

Under great management they thrive. Under poor management they get frustrated, burn-out, and leave.

These folks are critical to keep the system running smoothly. There's research! [Operators are the adaptive element that keeps brittle systems running](https://how.complexsystems.fail) and [this work stays largely invisible](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008651105359).

Here's the thing

If this sounds like you, keep going. The team appreciates you. Make sure you have a conversation with your boss _before_ performance review to add all the things you did to your list of goals. I do that all the time. _"Hey this ended up taking longer and contributed a,b,c to the company. Let's add it to my goals"_

If you're the boss, pay attention! Notice when folks do a great thing and give them kudos. Add to their goals. This will make _you_ look good to _your_ boss. It all ladders up.

And remember: Don't grind on something the company doesn't value. Hard work is not rewarded. **_Outcomes_** are rewarded. [I gave a whole talk about this](https://gitnation.com/contents/senior-isnt-about-your-tech-skills)

Cheers,<br/>

PS: this work becomes easier with the right title. At the staff/manager level your job description, I've found, explicitly says "find and fix the gaps, unblock others"
