Some of you might remember how [Lestat died](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=news/id=294) a while ago, six months&#x27; worth of a while ago apparently, and I&#x27;ve been reluctant to fix him because everything was so dated there was simply no point in patching it up. So I waited until Sunday when I could order all new bits, a fancy new motherboard, CPU, graphics card, RAM and even a speedy hard drive.

On wednesday all the parts arrived and in the evening I completely and totally neglected my girlfriend putting it all together. First I stripped out the old parts and yadayada, most of all I decided to do it nice and slow and to take great pleasure in it. Because hell, what greater pleasure is there for a geek than setting up a whole new computer from scratch, I&#x27;d&#x27;ve been up all night but for one thing. ... It didn&#x27;t work.

When I turned it on, suspense built up and then nothing happened. The fans were blasting, the front panel lights all burned and ... nothing else happened. The cause? Either a brand new CPU failure or a brand new motherboard failure. My bet was on CPU so yesterday I went to the store and asked for a new one, but the clerk, seemingly somewhat knowledgable, looked at it and said at least three pins didn&#x27;t settle so I should bring the motherboard in as well because perhaps the problem was there. So I did.

Thinking that we&#x27;d just do a quick check and they&#x27;ll give me my parts was a mistake, a stupid one I admit. The computer had to be left there to be looked over by their maintenance staff and it&#x27;d take at least a day, perhaps more, seeing as how it&#x27;s the weekend I&#x27;ll probably only get it next month. Fucking shit.

But after all of these shenanigans I am simply not enthusiastic about the computer anymore. It&#x27;ll be put together by a third party, somebody will&#x27;ve messed inside my computer that hasn&#x27;t been touched by anybody other than me in seven years. I feel somewhat violated, raped even. That&#x27;s _my_ computer and now somebody else is going to poke around in it! That&#x27;s just **wrong**.

If it comes back with windows installed, or the data on my old hdd is touched, I&#x27;m suing them ...
