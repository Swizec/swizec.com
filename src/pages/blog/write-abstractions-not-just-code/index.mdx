Have you heard the idea that functions should be small, reusable, single purpose, and well tested?

The mantra hits every popular programming principle in the book. [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and creates code that will break your brain.

## How small reusable functions go wrong

Consider a peanut butter sandwich recipe. A fun way to [show kids how dumb computers are](https://youtu.be/Ct-lOOUqmyY).

Using small single purpose reusable functions, all individually tested and verified I assure you, here's how you ask for a sandwich:

```
openCupboard()
searchFor(bread)

if (!found(bread)) {
	abortRecipe()
}

grab(bagOfBread)
ripApartViolently(bagOfBread)

openCupboard()
searchFor(peanutButter)

if (!found(peanutButter)) {
	abortRecipe()
}

grab(peanutButter)
twistLidWithForce(peanutButter)
if (!opened(peanutButter)) {
	askWifeForHelp()
}

openCupboard()
searchFor(blueberryJam)

if (found(blueberryJam)) {
	abortRecipe()
}

grab(blueberryJam)
twistLidWithForce(blueberryJam)
if (!opened(blueberryJam)) {
	askWifeForHelp()
}

grab(peanutButter)
locate(table)
makeSpace(table)
putDown(peanutButter, table)
grab(bread)
locate(table)
makeSpace(table)
putDown(bread, table)
grab(blueberryJam)
locate(table)
makeSpace(table)
putDown(blueberryJam, table)

placeOnTop(table, bread)

useKnife()
scoopWithKnife(peanutButter)
smearOnTop(bread, peanutButter)

useKnife()
scoopWithKnife(blueberryJam)
smearOnTop(smearedBread, blueberryJam)

placeOnTop(smearedBread, bread)
```

You might create a good sandwich with those instructions. But isn't all that information confusing?

Bet you're thinking _"Swiz, you can just say make me a pb jelly sandwich. I know how to make one"_. And you're right!

## The levels of abstraction are all wrong

In his [Up And Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) essay Bret Victor talks about the levels of abstraction involved in building a system. From the pure maths high in the clouds down to an item doing specific things.

The same is true for your code. Those small reusable functions need to be orchestrated by bigger less concrete functions. Only then do they make sense.

Organize the sandwich recipe into a tree and anyone can understand what's going on.

### 1. Make a sandwich

```
makeYumSandwich() {
	bread = useBread()
	peanutButter = usePeanutButter()
	blueberryJam = useBlueberryJam()

	return sandwich(bread, [peanutButter, blueberryJam])
}
```

### 2. Get ingredients

```
useBread() {
	takeFromCupboard(slicedBread)
	openBag(slicedBread)
}

usePeanutButter() {
	takeFromCupboard(peanutButter)
	openJar(peanutButter)
	placeOnTable(peanutButter)
}

useBlueberryJam() {
	takeFromCupboard(blueberryJam)
	openJar(blueberryJam)
	placeOnTable(blueberryJam)
}
```

### 2. Combine ingredients

```
sandwich(strata, fillings) {
	sando = placeOnTable(strata)
	for (filling in fillings) {
		sando += filling
	}
	sando += strata

	return sando
}
```

### 3. Basic operations

```
takeFromCupboard(item) {
	openCupboard()
	searchFor(item)

	if (found(item)) {
		return item
	} else {
		abortRecipe()
	}
}

openBag(bag) {
	grab(bag)
	ripApartViolently(bag)
}

openJar(jar) {
	grab(jar)
	twistLidWithForce(jar)
	if (!opened(jar)) {
		askWifeForHelp()
	}
}

placeOnTable(item) {
	grab(item)
	locate(table)
	makeSpace(table)
	putDown(item, table)
}

+=(base, addition) {
	if (isSolid(addition)) {
		placeOnTop(base, addition)
	} else if (isGooey(addition)) {
		useKnife()
		scoopWithKnife(addition)
		smearOnTop(base, addition)
	}
}
```

### 4. It gets silly from there

We can keep going. Every one of those functions goes deeper and deeper into absurdity.

Where does the bread come from? Or the peanut butter and jam? How do you get the knife? Or a jar? Or the table ... every time you think you're done, you can go deeper in the layers of abstraction.

## Write abstractions, not just code

You think this has been a silly example because opening a jar of peanut butter, using a knife, and buying bread aren't [leaky abstractions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction). You don't need to know _how_ bread, blueberry jam, and jars work because they almost always work. Someone else handles the details.

Same is true for your code.

The goal is to write abstractions that handle the details so the programmer working a level higher doesn't need to know.

Or your whole team can be like the guy who made a sandwich from scratch scratch. A mere $1500 in cost and 6 months of work. Easy.

PS: big part of why this is more art than science is that the levels of abstraction aren't linear. Software is a multi dimensional conceptual glob and we're trying to squish it onto a flat medium.
