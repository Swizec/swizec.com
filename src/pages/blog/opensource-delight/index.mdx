You know why I love working on open source programming? It&#x27;s not because the model in itself is a wonder or even that good, frankly it has many problems, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re here to discuss. It&#x27;s not even because I love giving back to the community. The reasons are completely and totally vain and because, well, it&#x27;s easier to do open source than closed source.

One thing about open source is that every now and then I get an e-mail from a developer that so loved a function or two of mine that they felt like they should tell me about how much it helped them. And sometimes, just sometimes, something far better happens.

Today I received this:

Hi Swizec,

Just wanted to say – great function!

I couldn’t work out why it was working until I littered it with traces and realised that because directories are listed last (I&#x27;d never thought to look), there&#x27;s no recursion issues, as the files are already disposed of.

That&#x27;s a neat trick to take advantage of!

Cheers,

Dave

And at first I even thought he was right, wow, he found out something about my own code I did not know. But a moment later it hit me and I explained to him his error and that the reason said function works is that it first goes into the directory and removes it after it&#x27;s empty. Neat trick, not too obvious apparently. His next response was also quite a delight:

Hey Swizec.

You&#x27;re right. You&#x27;re right!  
I do lots and lots of recursion for all sorts of things, but in my head this  
definitely seemed more complicated, as the removal of directories demands  
you start from the &quot;outside in&quot; rather than the &quot;inside out&quot;. But as you&#x27;ve proved, doing the branches first is the workaround.  
It&#x27;s great being wrong! A little humbling (which I admit, I&#x27;m not THAT keen  
on!) but you get to learn something new.  
Thanks for the workout!  
Cheers,  
Dave

We were talking about [this](http://si.php.net/manual/en/function.rmdir.php#76806) function by the way.

So thank you Dave Stewart, whoever you are, for making my day.
