On Sunday I went to boot camp - an hour of fast paced [calisthenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics "Calisthenics") - followed half an hour later by [boxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing "Boxing") practice. Three hours at the gym in total. On a sunny, if cold, Sunday afternoon. I had also spent half an hour working out that morning. That evening, whimpering in bed from muscle soreness, complaining loudly, but secretly enjoying every moment, it dawned on me that this might not be normal. ![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tAksLfZcRAmuZv2A4tIj) ![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/etIlPIqTRSiFoFDE4sQg) Every day the internet tells me that as a human being of a sit-down, stare-at-a-computer persuasion, I should cower from physical strain. I should be looking up to the [30% of the population that isn't fat](http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/obesity-in-the-us/), admire the perhaps 5% that's actually in shape, and shout profanities at society for making me feel bad about my body while nomming on a bag of crisps. If that's normal, then there is definitely something wrong with me. Deeply and horrifically wrong. Last week I spent 20 hours working out, the week before that it was 18. Both weeks I spent only 19 hours doing full on productive billable work. And about 18 hours writing. I also count calories, watch what I eat, and I don't even remember what a sugar craving feels like anymore. I must be deeply disturbed ... But how does a person even get to the point where a third of their productive time is spent working out?

## How the hell?
