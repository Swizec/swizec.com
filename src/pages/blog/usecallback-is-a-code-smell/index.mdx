One of my favorite ways to simplify and de-gotcha React code is to rip out all the `useCallback` and `useMemo` drama. 90% of the time you don't need it.

## What useCallback is for

`useCallback` and friends are React hooks that help you create a stable reference to a JavaScript object, which helps React's rendering engine understand the object hasn't changed.

For example:

```javascript
function FidgetSpinner() {
	const [spinning, setSpinning] = useState(false)

	const newFuncEveryTime = () => {
		setSpinning(!spinning)
	}

	const stableFunc = useCallback(() => {
		setSpinning(!spinning)
	}, [spinning])

	return (
		<>
			<p>Is it spinning? {spinning}</p>
			<Spinner spinning={spinning} onClick={...} />
		</>
	)
}
```

Assume `<Spinner>` renders a fidget spinner that's either spinning or not. The `onClick` prop accepts a function that updates the `spinning` state.

You can't move that state into `<Spinner>` because you want to show the description. You need to handle `onClick` inside the `<Spinner>` because that's what renders DOM elements.

### Referential stability and re-renders

React uses prop values to decide when to re-render the `<Spinner>` component. When values change, components re-render.

For functions and other objects that "value" is their memory address. Known as a reference. Even if the function or object looks the same, but lives in a new address, React thinks it's different and re-renders your component.

That's where `useCallback` comes in.

```javascript
const newFuncEveryTime = () => {
  setSpinning(!spinning)
}
```

This is a new function any time React's engine touches the `<FidgetSpinner>` component (calls the function). Whether it updates the DOM or not, calling the component re-defines this function with a new memory address. That causes a re-render of `<Spinner>`.

```javascript
const stableFunc = useCallback(() => {
  setSpinning(!spinning)
}, [spinning])
```

This creates a memoized function with a stable memory address. It only creates a new function when the dependency array changes. In this case any time `spinning`'s value changes, `useCallback` re-instantiates your function with a new address.

### useCallback gotchas

There is a tricky potential bug in my code above ðŸ‘‰ the wrong dependency array creates a good old JavaScript closure problem.

Define it like this:

```javascript
const stableFunc = useCallback(() => {
  setSpinning(!spinning)
}, [])
```

And the `spinning` value is baked into the function "forever". Calling this function won't toggle `spinning` from false to true and back as you'd expect, it's always going to set it to true. Or false if the initial value was true.

That's a big gotcha for dubious performance benefits.

## Why engineers useCallback

A reply likened it to "using sunscreen at night" ðŸ¤£

There's 2 understandable reasons I've seen:

1.  **Engineer is worried about performance** and wants to help. Admirable goal! But `useCallback` and friends introduce a memory overhead. JavaScript machinery needs to keep a stack of all those memoized functions and lug it around wherever a component goes. Do it too much or get it subtly wrong and this leads to fun memory leaks and stale renders. Big problem in ye olden days of hand-rolled "frameworks".
2.  **Engineer encounters an infinite loop**. This one sucks. It happens when you use an unstable callback or object as a `useEffect` dependency. Every render re-defines the callback, triggers the effect, causes a re-render, which ... ðŸ˜¬

And there's a third version I've seen that ... why??

```javascript
function Component() {
  const SubComponent = useCallback(() => {
    return <div>This is a component damn it!</div>
  }, [])

  return (
    <>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
      {SubComponent()}
    </>
  )
}
```

_Please_ don't do that. Define a component and let React do its thing. ðŸ¥º

## How you can avoid useCallback

https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1570173097877327872

Best way to avoid `useCallback` is by moving your functions out of component scope. Use [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) that depend fully on passed-in arguments instead of values in scope.

### Example 1

A better version of the example above looks like this:

```javascript
function FidgetSpinner() {
  const [spinning, setSpinning] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <p>Is it spinning? {spinning}</p>
      <Spinner spinning={spinning} setSpinning={setSpinning} />
    </>
  )
}
```

`setSpinning` is a stable function! You can pass it into `<Spinner>`, which can use its alternative form to toggle state:

```javascript
setSpinning((spinning) => !spinning)
```

You can call React setters with a function that gets current value as its argument.

### Example 2

Another common opportunity is turning functions using local scope into independent (testable ðŸ¤˜) functions. Like when building forms with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

```javascript
function ComplicatedStuff() {
  const formMethods = useForm()

  const fieldValue = formMethods.watch("field")

  return (
    <>
      <p>Live current value of field: {fieldValue}</p>
      <FormRenderComponent onSubmit={onSubmit} />
    </>
  )
}
```

`formMethods.watch` watches your input field and returns its current value. Great when you're building dynamic forms.

The temptation is to then write the `onSubmit` function like this:

```javascript
function ComplicatedStuff() {
	const formMethods = useForm()

	const fieldValue = formMethods.watch('field')

	async function onSubmit() {
		await fetch('...', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: JSON.stringify({
				fieldValue
			})
		})
	}
```

Then you think _"Oh no, performance!"_ and memoize that function with a `useCallback`. Run into staleness issues and add all the fields into its dependency array.

Now you have unnecessary full re-renders on every keypress ðŸ’©

Instead, try this:

```javascript
async function onSubmit(values) {
	await fetch('...', {
		method: 'POST',
		body: JSON.stringify({
			fieldValue: values.fieldValue
		})
	})
}

function ComplicatedStuff() {
	const formMethods = useForm()

	const fieldValue = formMethods.watch('field')
```

React-hook-form passes all current values into the `onSubmit` function. You don't need to rely on component scope!

### Cough

Sure, that's how _this_ library works, my point is the general principle ðŸ‘‰ look for opportunities to refactor your functions so they rely on arguments instead of scope.

https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1570179303689818113

Then you can move them anywhere. Flexibility ðŸ¤© (and stable references)

## When _do_ you need useCallback and friends?

If you're writing a library or core piece of functionality that's going to show up in lots of components, memoize all the things.

![](./img/6tmch3jpgc6dc4j.jpeg)

A library like [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) or [useAuth](https://useauth.dev/) can make your whole app re-render by accident. You do want to prevent that.

A callback shared in 3 small components? Meh. Focus on keeping renders fast instead of worrying about re-renders.

PS: [computers are fast these days](https://swizec.com/blog/screw-web-performance-just-wait-a-little/) and in [my experiments with React 18](https://swizec.com/blog/a-better-react-18-starttransition-demo/) it took thousands of elements to notice performance issues

PPS: I hear rumors the React team is working on an auto-memoizing engine that handles all this for you ðŸ¤ž
