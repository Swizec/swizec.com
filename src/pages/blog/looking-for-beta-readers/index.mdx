Wanna read my hardest engineering lessons learned? You're in luck!

I finished the manuscript ðŸ¥³

- 10 months of writing,
- 28 chapters,
- 47,700 words,
- lots of charts and pictures.

The book started as a Manning project in late 2022, got killed, then I started again from scratch in February 2024 with a better more interesting angle â€“

What software engineering through a hockey-stick looks like. Based on my experiences in fast growing startups, supported by academic research. Trying to answer the question: What _actually_ matters in a business context?

Right now I'm looking for beta readers [name|]. You get a super early first draft of the book and your feedback will shape what it becomes.

This is not a vomit draft. I edit a lot while writing. I'd feel comfortable publishing the book as is, but your input will make it so much better.

If that sounds interesting ðŸ‘‰ https://forms.gle/Bk9MkWPHmA1xCaxW6
