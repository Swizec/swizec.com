## PINK!

Make the rope pink and voila, a whole market of indoor female climbers scrambling over each other to buy your rope because it's prettier. Even better, these guys are now buying rope from the Czech manufacturer, dying it pink (or whatever the colour of the season is) and marketing it to climbing girls the world over. Nobody else is going to move in on their market because it's too sissy. A real man's climbing gear manufacturer can't afford to be associated with a sissy product. Just like you and I, they scoff at the idea of "Pfah, pink rope. Don't make me laugh. As if colour's got anything to do with anything. That's not even a real value proposition!" Here's the real kicker, when I told this story to my sister or any of my female friends, the idea of "Yeah, just make it pink, right?" came up the moment I mentioned indoor climbers. PS: my sister keeps complaining that running shoes for real athletes are all ugly. So do all her friends. Anyone wanna do something about it?
