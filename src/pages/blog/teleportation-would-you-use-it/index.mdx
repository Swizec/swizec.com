[![To be or not to be (a clone), by Stéfan](./img/3555-3459513455_abe70e7f85_z.jpg "To be or not to be (a clone), by Stéfan")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/st3f4n/3459513455/) _Warning: the possible side-effects of reading this post include, but are not limited to, ethical dilemmas, wistful thinking and yearning for the future._ Next to warp speed [teleportation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation "Teleportation") is one of the few science fiction promises we still haven't got. Mostly because, as it turns out, they are still theoretically impossible. Something about accelerating mass to light speed and infinities. It seems the only way to teleport a person, who is probably too big to play around with quantum teleportation, is by [cloning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning "Cloning") them. The process would work in three steps:

1.  Make digital copy of person - body, thoughts and all
2.  Synthesise person on the destination with thoughts etc. intact
3.  Dispose of original

Star Trek used a similar trick with their teleports. Kirk would step on the plate, some buzzing, a flash, a bit of sparkles, whooosh and he was on the planet surface, ready to take on the world and making sure whomever was wearing the red shirt wouldn't come back. Nothing wrong with this right?
