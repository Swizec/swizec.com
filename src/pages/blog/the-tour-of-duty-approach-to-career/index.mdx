Quick note today to plant the seed of an idea I've always loved: The Tour of Duty.

https://x.com/Swizec/status/1825539727795310683

The Tour of Duty is a modern way to approach your career. Originally published by Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and a couple of business authors in 2013, the tour of duty is a way to reconcile two opposing ideas:

How can you change jobs as needed and still have A Career?

_You_ own your career \[name|], not your boss. I've talked about this in [Own your career like an expert](https://swizec.com/blog/own-your-career-like-an-expert/). Modern careers are not a straight line, they look like this:

The boss hires you to do a job, [gives you a 4 year package](https://swizec.com/blog/what-if-engineers-were-paid-like-athletes/), and everyone plays this little rah-rah-rah charade about how jobs are forever. But everyone understands there's a job to be done and that there might not be another after that.

Hoffman suggests a better idea: **Don't do the charade part**.

Have a conversation with your boss. What's the goal here? What were you hired to achieve? How will they know this is working? How will _you_ know this is working?

Then set goals and check-in at appropriate intervals.

A good tour of duty sets higher level goals that take a few quarters or even years to achieve. When those goals are achieved, it's normal to shake hands and part ways. This is a successful outcome, not a failure. You did the thing! Now it's time go do the thing somewhere else.

You should [read the whole HBR article](https://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact). It's great.

Or if you prefer a podcast version, Hoffman [talks about it here](https://mastersofscale.com/reid-hoffman-make-everyone-a-hero-part-two/)
