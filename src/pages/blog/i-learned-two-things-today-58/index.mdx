Today I learned that [Palo Alto](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.4291666667,-122.138055556&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.4291666667,-122.138055556 (Palo%20Alto%2C%20California)&amp;t=h> "Palo Alto, California") really really sucks for [partying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party "Party"). I know this isn&#x27;t the first time I have learned this and that after being stuck in the house for a whole week doing nothing but starting at the screen and producing coloured pixels roughly shaped into instructions a computer might understand as orders ... it&#x27;s almost better than nothing. It&#x27;s not that the whole thing is inherently bad. There&#x27;s two whole bars you can go partying in! But there just isn&#x27;t enough choice and the atmosphere in [Nola](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.9333333333,14.5333333333&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=40.9333333333,14.5333333333 (Nola)&amp;t=h> "Nola")&#x27;s and The Old Pro just simply isn&#x27;t my thing. The music kind of sucks, there are too many people cramped into a single space and there is no dancing. When I have to endure a crowd, I want the crowd to at least be dancing to cool music. Another thing that I learned is that I am a far far cry from a professional writer still. Writing things on demand simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, or maybe today was a specially bad day for that ... it&#x27;s really difficult to tell with these creative things when you&#x27;re just not good enough to produce on demand and when you just simply need some inspiration, increasing the entropy in your life and so on. Should work on that.
