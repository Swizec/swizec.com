[![Cupcakes by lamantin](./img/4040-5143354092_9aef18b63e_o.png "Cupcakes by lamantin")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lamantin/5143354092/sizes/m/in/photostream/) A while ago I realized that whenever someone asks me if I know any javascript developers, I always come up empty. Shame on me! Using a technology heavily for many years and not really knowing anyone from the community. That&#x27;s why I decided to organise a meetup! The first purely Javascript event in Ljubljana. Sure there have been barcamps and webcamps and mobilecamps ... plenty of occasional Javascript users come to those, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re on about here. This time we want to focus on people who use Javascript _a lot_. [Come join us](http://www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-JavaScript-User-Group/events/112046942/) on the 30th of April at 7pm in Kiberpipa! It&#x27;s gonna be fun! People doing full stack Javascript, or writing fancy frontend apps in various MV\* frameworks. That sort of stuff. It&#x27;s time the community gets to know each other, or at least for me to find the community. :) I&#x27;m happy to announce that after weeks of effort (read: remembering to send an email or tweet a link once in a while) we finally have four presenters, free beer and plenty of people who promised they&#x27;d make it. Hooray! There&#x27;s even going to be a lady giving one of those talks! That one did actually take a lot of effort to find ... I don&#x27;t know what is it with girls, but it sure is difficult to find some willing to give a talk about something cool in front of a bunch of dudes. We&#x27;re not that scary, are we? Here&#x27;s the list of talks:

- AngularJS ([Luka Zakrajsek](https://twitter.com/bancek))
- Frontend testing with Casperjs ([Robert Basic](https://twitter.com/robertbasic))
- MV\* libraries (Jana Bergant)
- Bare Metal Coding: Optimising Your Javascript for Leaner, Meaner Performance ([Klemen Slaviƒç](https://twitter.com/krofdrakula))

There are also going to be cupcakes! What do you think a JavaScript Cupcake should look like? I really need your help with this one. Google doesn&#x27;t have a single idea. Imagine that, all these years and nobody&#x27;s tried to design a javascript cupcake before.
