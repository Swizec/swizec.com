That was the inspirational _OMG THIS IS AWESOME_ part of the lecture. Two algorithms are essential to achieving this: localization and [path planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning "Motion planning").

### Localization

For localization they use something called [monte carlo localization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization "Monte Carlo localization"). It uses a particle filter as the beating heart of the approach - it sounds all fancy, but it's really quite a simple approach. Basically the idea is that you take measurements from your sensors and randomly scatter some points on your likely location. Then you compare measurements with whatever you know is correct for each point and assign appropriate weights - basically saying "Ok, if I am on a road marking there is a 90% chance the sensor will say 'White'". After some normalization you take points with the most weight and move them forward a bit, adding some scatter and eventually you become very certain of your location on the road because the algorithm converges into a single point.

### Path planning

So there you have it, the basics for making a car that drives itself :)
