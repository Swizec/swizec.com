## Enter tramp-mode

Over the past few weeks I've been working on a project that frowns upon the idea of working locally - something about data security when dealing with banking-like systems. Whatever. The only access to my code was the humble _ssh_. Now fucking what? Running emacs via _[ssh -X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell")_ was painfully slow. Using Vim for more than config editing? Surely, you're joking \[mr. Feynman]!? After a week of miserably living my life via _ssh -X_ I finally broke down and googled for a solution. Took me long enough ... My surprisingly short search (took me all of 10 minutes) discovered something called _tramp-mode_ - a remote-editing mode for emacs. Since emacs22 it comes bundled with the basic install, so there's no need to add anything. It. Is. Amazing. _C-x C-f //_ and away we go. Enter username@ (lovingly autocompleted by the file finder thingy), add the hostname (also autocompleted). Asks for the password and voila, I'm browsing a remote computer via _ssh_. From what I understand, tramp-mode doesn't actually keep you connected via ssh for live editing on the remote machine. That would be slow, a [TCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") round-about for every keystroke ... no good. Instead it uses _scp_ to copy files locally, let you edit them and when you save the file is copied back into its original location. For added awesomeness, _C-x C-f_ undestands you're editing remotely so it always starts finding files relative to the remote location. Magic. All the flexibility of editing locally, all the whatever-you-need-this-for of secure remote connections. ... But I will still edit configs with Vim. It's only natural.
