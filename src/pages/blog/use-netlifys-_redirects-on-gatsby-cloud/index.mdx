Something always goes wrong when you change hosting providers. No matter how many times you've been through this before. 😅

For me it was redirects. A vital feature of any site migration.

Last year I [migrated my 13+ year old Wordpress blog to Gatsby](https://swizec.com/blog/lessons-from-migrating-a-14-year-old-blog-with-1500-posts-to-gatsby/). The migration is ongoing, several things remain wonky. You can read about [exporting 1500 wordpress articles to markdown, here](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-export-a-large-wordpress-site-to-markdown/), and [first steps on the journey here](https://swizec.com/blog/moving-13-years-of-wordpress-blog-to-gatsby-markdown/). From September 2019 😱

## Why thousands of redirects??

Redirects translate between Wordpress URLs and the new, cleaner, Gatsby URLs.

They come in 2 types:

1. Article redirects in frontmatter
2. Page redirects in `_redirects`

Frontmatter redirects tell Gatsby to translate any old URLs to their new shape. [Cool URLs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) and my SEO tool says swizec.com gets 26,000 backlinks these days. 🚀

Page redirects are for housekeeping.

`/serverless-handbook` links to [`https://serverlesshandbook.dev`](https://serverlesshandbook.dev), `/reactd3js` goes to [`https://reactfordataviz.com`](https://reactfordataviz.com), old images on `/wp-content/` redirect to their new homes in `/static/` (thousands of images), and a few others.

## The incident

All this worked fine until one day I had the bright idea: _"Eh now that Gatsby Cloud offers hosting, why do I keep paying for Netlify, it just slows down deploys"_

I pressed the red button.

![](giphy:big_red_button)

And it worked!

Gatsby Cloud is a great host and Gatsby is a self-contained system. Everything went great!

Switched DNS settings, turned off Netlify, nobody noticed.

Until a few weeks later … wait something's weird. That's a lot of broken links and images. 🤨

## Going from Netlify to Gatsby Cloud

You can go from Netlify to Gatsby Cloud quickly in theory. I was already using Gatsby Cloud for builds and deploying to Netlify.

Gatsby uses plugins to adapt itself for different hosts. Redirects and HTTP headers mostly.

On Netlify you use `gatsby-plugin-netlify`. For Gatsby Cloud you'll change that to `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`. Their config is about the same.

Change the DNS setting on your domain and that's it.

But you gotta tell Gatsby about all your redirects so the host plugin knows! That's what creates the final config.

## Article redirects with markdown frontmatter

I wanted to keep article-specific redirects simple. Add configuration to each article instead of a global config file.

```
---
title: "My cool article"
description: "You should read this for sure"
categories: "epic, amazing"
redirect_from: /
---
```

Article frontmatter configures the title, description, categories, and a redirect_from. That's the old URL. Yes they're weird.

You make that work by hooking into Gatsby's page creation lifecycle in `gatsby-node.js`

```javascript
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const result = await graphql(`
    {
      allMdx(filter: { frontmatter: { redirect_from: { ne: null } } }) {
        edges {
          node {
            fields {
              slug
            }
            frontmatter {
              redirect_from
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    console.log(result.errors)
    throw result.errors
  }

  const allPosts = result.data.allMdx.edges

  // For all posts with redirect_from frontmatter,
  // extract all values and push to redirects array
  allPosts.forEach((post) => {
    const from = post.node.frontmatter.redirect_from
    const to = post.node.fields.slug

    from.forEach((from) => {
      actions.createRedirect({
        fromPath: from,
        toPath: to,
        isPermanent: true,
        redirectInBrowser: true,
      })
    })
  })

  console.log(`${chalk.green("success")} create redirects`)
}
```

0. Run when pages are being created
1. Find files with `redirect_from` fields
2. Bail if error
3. Iterate through results
4. Run `createRedirect` action for each

Other plugins then take those redirects and configure them for your host. Gatsby Cloud's puts them in a `_redirects.json` for example.

_Funfact: this one broke because the slug field on Gatsby Cloud includes /blog/ and on Netlify it didn't_ 🤷‍♀️

## Page redirects with `_redirects`

For known redirects, Netlify's `_redirects` file is fast becoming an industry standard.

```
/serverless-handbok   https://serverlesshandbook.dev
/reactd3js   https://reactfordataviz.com
.
.
.
```

One redirect per line, `from` on the left, `to` on the right. Easy peasy.

Gatsby Cloud doesn't care about this file 💩

Instead you have to add this function to your `gatsby-node.js`.

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
exports.onPreBootstrap = ({ actions }) => {
  // read _redirects
  // call createRedirect for each

  const redirects = fs.readFileSync("./static/_redirects").toString()

  for (const line of redirects.split("\n")) {
    if (line.trim().length > 0) {
      // found a redirect
      const [fromPath, toPath] = line.trim().split(/\s+/)
      actions.createRedirect({
        fromPath,
        toPath,
      })
    }
  }

  console.log(`${chalk.green("success")} create redirects from _redirects`)
}
```

0. Runs after Gatsby inits, before other machinery
1. Read the `static/_redirects` file
2. Iterate line by line
3. Split by whitespace
4. Call `createRedirect` action

And after all that I still have a `:splat` config for my redirects that isn't working. Broken images 🥲

Next time you change hosting, check everything my friend 😅
