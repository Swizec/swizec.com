It was in reply to [A work ritual that keeps me sane](https://swizec.com/blog/a-work-ritual-that-keeps-me-sane/).

Trupti says they're a developer turned technical lead. This is a jarring transition! Going from doing the work to orchestrating the work is no joke.

Yes tech leads and staff engineers are in the weeds. They're not managers. But the work is different than that of an engineer cranking out code.

## Your work is important

A while back I complained to my manager that all I ever do anymore is interview people and write feedback. No time to do work.

He sighed and said _"Yes and that's important work. Without good engineers we can't grow and without thoughtful recaps we can't make decisions. Keep going"_

Roadmap meetings, planning, discussing solutions, and slicing stories can feel the same. Why are we all sitting around _talking_ when there's shit to be done!?

Because it's important.

Important work rarely feels urgent. Urgent work is rarely important.

## The job of a senior+ engineer

As a senior+ engineer you're thinking many steps ahead.

Less _"How do we get this story done?"_ more _"How do we get every story done?"_. Plus a lot of _"What fits in the time available and fulfills the requirements? Which requirements can we re-negotiate?"_

I like how Pat Fry, an F1 tech chief, [said it on a podcast](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.beyond-the-grid-alpine-tech-chief-pat-fry-on-35-years-at-the-top-of-f1.2YHdw7OtDKCS5Tn8ciVOwn.html):

You're doing the important work that never feels like work for _today_. That's where the guilt comes from, I think. You're pushing away the urgent to focus on the important.

And that's the job! That's what senior+ is all about. Creating time to focus on important brain work.

You are no longer [selling your hands](https://swizec.com/blog/theres-two-types-of-engineers/). You're selling your experience, battle scars, and opinions. That's the value add.

The coding may be slowing you down! A bottleneck to your value. You'll have a much bigger impact by getting 5 engineers aligned and pulling in the same direction than by trying to do the work yourself.

Or as a coworker once said in a peer feedback survey: _"Swiz is great but he doesn't have to do \_all\_ of the work."_

### Force multiplier

You're a force multiplier.

By giving you that senior+ role, the company is saying they care more about your impact on the team and engineering org than they do about the code you write.

I like to share this video in [Senior Mindset](https://swizec.com/senior-mindset/) workshops:

It shows how wolves transformed Yellowstone. By hunting deer they made rivers greener, the ecosystem richer, and the bison happier. ðŸ¤¨

Small move, big impact. That's the goal. No guilt required.
