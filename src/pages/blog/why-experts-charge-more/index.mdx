When there's a YouTube video, recipe, or course for everything, how can experts charge so much? If anyone can learn to code, why do senior engineers routinely get $200,000+ per year? ü§®

Let me tell you a story from my first year of owning a bike.

![Swizec's bike next to a bridge](./img/Swizecs-bike-next-to-a-bridgecfia42.png)

Back when this beauty was new, she developed a clutch problem. Pull in the lever, the clutch gets stuck, you fall over in a walking-speed corner like a sack of potatoes.

Don't ask how I know üòÖ

Bikes lean to steer. And they're heavy. You need power to stand up from a lean. Engaged clutch üëâ no power.

I figured this was unusual for a bike that's 6 months old. I'll take her back to the dealership, see what they say.

## The generalist can figure anything out

The dealership specializes in Triumphs, Ducatis, and Moto Guzzis. They have a bunch of mechanics on staff.

A mechanic looks at the bike and scratches his head.

_"I don't know man, could be anything. Maybe the clutch is broken, maybe the cable's getting stuck, or it's the lever itself. I see there's a bang near the clutch where you dropped the bike ... honestly dude this is like a 3 hour job. I'd have to take your bike apart and dig into the issues. Best you make an appointment."_

I suffer with the clutch for a few more weeks. If you push the lever out with your fingers, it's almost reliable!

## The expert takes one look

At the appointment I get a Triumph expert.

He tries the clutch and grunts. Then he hmms and he squints and he says _"Triumph over-tightens that screw from the factory. I don't know why. We loosen it when setting up the bike for you, but sometimes it goes back. Here, lemme loosen the screw for ya"_

Dude pulls out his keychain with a tiny pocket wrench, pokes at the clutch lever for 10 seconds and it's perfect. Smooth as butter. 10 second fix, 2 minute chat, didn't charge a dime.

## The "video for everything" guy, he struggles

At $150/hour that Triumph specialist gets expensive fast. And he doesn't enjoy boring routine tasks.

So [I learned how to fix my own bike](https://swizec.com/blog/theres-a-youtube-video-for-everything/) üë®‚Äçüîß

Wrenching on your bike is fun! Very relaxing. You watch a video, struggle for an hour, accomplish a routine task that impresses nobody but you.

Righty tighty, lefty loosy! I forgot that once and almost made the rear brakes unfixable. Had to bring out the 5ft wrench üòÖ

When the Piston & Chain club went out of business, wrenching became difficult. No more workshop. No more tools. Gotta buy your own.

I now have 3 different spark plug sockets, 5 sets of spark plugs that didn't fit, and a strong understanding of my limits. Spent a whole afternoon running around buying tools and supplies for a fix that takes 2 minutes. But I can replace my own spark plugs now üí™

## How to become an expert

The expert does less work, but they _do the right work_.

The quickest way to get there is to choose a niche and dig. [You need a positioning statement](https://swizec.com/blog/why-you-need-a-positioning-statement/).
