That was on Friday. I still don’t know _why_ the bug happens, but I can reproduce it. Evidence says it’s a Chrome 52 bug, not a general JavaScript bug. Neither Safari nor Firefox make it happen.

Sometimes when you call `.fetch()` on a Backbone model, callbacks don’t fire. There’s no JavaScript error, the REST call works, the result is vanished by the browser. Joy of joys.

You need:

- Webpack
- Babel 6
- Backbone (maybe Backbone is doing it wrong?)
- A server that can serve JSON files
- 14 lines of code

I used `create-react-app` to set up a basic environment, ejected with `npm run eject` and added some config to Webpack to allow jQuery. Backbone depends on it. This part is not _that_ relevant.

To show the bug itself, we need a Backbone model:

```javascript
// A basic Backbone model
class BugModel extends Backbone.Model {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.url = "bla.json";
  }
}
```

Now I know what you’re thinking, that’s an ES6 object and Backbone was built before ES6. Official docs never mention the new `class` syntax. The traditional Backbone approach works too:

```javascript
var BugModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  url: "bla.json",
});
```

The same bug happens. I tried.

To cause the bug, we have to call `.fetch()` on two instances of `BugModel` that share the same `id`. The code looks like this:

```javascript
let bug = new BugModel();
bug.fetch({
  success: () => {
    console.log("fetch 1"); // this happens
    doWeirdness(bug);
  },
});

function doWeirdness(bug) {
  let newBug = new BugModel({ id: bug.id });

  console.log("about to re-fetch");

  newBug.fetch({
    success: () => console.log("fetch 2", newBug), // don't get here
    error: () => console.log("error"),
  });
}
```

We create an instance of `BugModel` in a variable called `bug`, then call `.fetch()`. This makes an API call to `/bla.json`, which returns a JSON file that looks like this: `{"id": 1, "hai": "hello"}`.

Backbone automagically parses this JSON string and sets an `id` and `hai` attribute. This part works like a charm.

Then we call `doWeirdness` and pass our `bug` object as an attribute. Inside `doWeirdness`, we make a new instance of `BugModel` called `newBug` and give it the same `id` as `bug` had. This is a crucial step.

When we call `fetch` on this new instance, the API call happens, but the callbacks do not. `'fetch 2'` never prints.

This whole sequence of events might sound redundant, but it made sense in my real codebase. Even if re-fetching objects doesn’t make sense, it _should_ work. It works in both Safari and Firefox.

## Clues about why

This smells like a bug in memory optimization. Chrome thinks `bug` and `newBug` are the same object, even though they are not.

If you call `fetch()` twice on the same instance of `BugModel`, the same bug happens. (clue, part 1)

If both instances have a different `id`, both `fetch` calls fire callbacks. (clue, part 2)

Curiously, if you add a third `fetch()` call, that works.

```javascript
newBug.fetch({
  success: () => console.log("fetch 2", newBug), // don't get here
  error: () => console.log("error"),
});

newBug.fetch({
  success: () => console.log("fetch 3"), // prints
});
```

The bug didn’t happen in Chrome 51.

I am confused. ?
