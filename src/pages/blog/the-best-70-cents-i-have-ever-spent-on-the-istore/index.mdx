> Last night I cut the light off in my bedroom. Hit the switch, was in bed before the room was dark. ~ Muhammad Ali

## I learned stuff!

So far azumio's alarm clock has turned up a lot of useful info:

- I sleep like a log - on most nights I almost don't come out of deep sleep until it's wakeup time
- I am a snoozer - the last half hour to an hour of every night is spent essentially fully awake, except I don't remember anything and am fairly certain I'm asleep
- I fall asleep instantly - when I watch a movie to fall asleep, I spend ten to twenty minutes fully awake, then I am suddenly asleep. The transition usually takes less than three minutes.
