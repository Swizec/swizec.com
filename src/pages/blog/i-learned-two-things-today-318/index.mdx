![Moleskine notebook and diaries.](https://swizec.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/300px-Moleskine_-_023.jpg)

Today I learned that [yesterday's post](https://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-308/) where I spoke about the wonderful statics textbook that architects use it sounded a bit like a scathing review not only of the book itself, but the people reading it and that this was a bit ... unkind, even mean.

To be honest, all that stuff I just found funny, there was actually a lot of interesting new things in the book as well. Like did you know wood only burns at a pace of 0.6mm per minute, retains core structural integrity and that despite being the most flammable building material is still the best thing for a fire due to poor [heat conductivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) and that it doesn't collapse under heat like metals do? Or become brittle like concrete?

And ... uhm ... some complex stuff about why things stand up and how all of that works.

Another thing that I learned was that the Official [Moleskine iPad App](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moleskine/id429657255?mt=8) is _crap_. Was writing a rather lengthy blogpost last night - I find it easier to draft these things up somewhere other than the blog. Especially the more proper ones. After two hours of writing I pressed a button and the whole post vanished.

No ability to get it back or anything.

Moleskine iPad App ... you do _not_ behave like a notebook! Why can't you be as awesome as a real [Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/)?
