Haven&#x27;t posted in quite a while, been busy and when you add a pinch of lazy to the mix you get some pretty powerful magic.

In the past week I&#x27;ve discovered two very interesting and awesome things. One is browser based gaming, sure I&#x27;ve been told about it, but wow it&#x27;s awesome once youa ctually try. [This](http://imperiaonline.org) has got to be the best MMORPG I&#x27;ve ever played. It&#x27;s got all the properties of a MMORPG, except perhaps for an active environment, but in the mean time it&#x27;s lacking all of the bad properties. It doesn&#x27;t eat up all of your time and it certainly doesn&#x27;t glue you to the computer screen for hours on end. On top of that [Imperia Online](http://imperiaonline.org) has very nice hand drawn images that are simply marvelous to look at.

Another great discovery was [Death &amp; Maiden](http://www.cartoontomb.de/english/death.php) a very funny webcomic that speaks of Death being quite the interesting and complex character that is getting cheated by a mere girly. The first part was great, sadly it&#x27;s finished already, and the second part is showing great promise, although it&#x27;s made in a somewhat different naration style. So guess we&#x27;ll see...
