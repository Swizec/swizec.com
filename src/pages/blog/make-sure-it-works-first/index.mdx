We love elegant systems and code. They feel good. But elegance is not the question. First you gotta make sure it works and solves the problem on time and under budget. Because anyone can make a bridge that stands, but it takes an engineer to build a bridge that _barely_ stands.

We talked about this and other insights from my upcoming book with [Bas Steins on his podcast](https://bas.fm/e/17). I think you'll enjoy the conversation.

Additionally my talk from TechLeadConf last month is now public. You'll hear about lessons learned while tripling the size of our engineering in a year. It's been a wild ride.

It's [one of my best talks](https://gitnation.com/contents/leadership-insights-from-growing-2x-in-8-months)

I swear my camera looked better when we were recording.
