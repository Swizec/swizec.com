Which of these do you think is the higher quality restaurant?

a) burgers.

b) burgers, chinese, sushi, pizza, thai, pasta, steak, fish, vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, meat lovers, kosher, kebab, halal, breakfast, goulash

So why does your resumé look like a technology bingo card?

Here's the thing: When I'm looking for a burger, I'll go to the best burger place I can find. And no kosher person will trust a restaurant that serves breakfast bacon.

Your resumé can't appeal to every job. Make sure it appeals to the one you want.
