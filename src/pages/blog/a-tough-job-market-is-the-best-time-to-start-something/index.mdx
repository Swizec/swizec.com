Here's how to navigate a tough job market from someone dumb enough to have done it before. Me.

I started my career in 2007/08. Yep right before the financial crash. Didn't matter, Slovenia's market for developers was very early back then. The whole "tech scene" could fit in a room.

I started web development in 2002. Yep right after the dotcom crash. ~~People~~ Teachers told me the web was over and a waste of time. But I was a high school freshman and didn't care. You mean I can write code _and show people what I built!? They don't even have to come visit!? THIS IS AMAZING 🤯_

Before that all my programs had the huge huge audience of my friends and family.

## Times are bad ... maybe

Ok so, here's a chart of new job openings going back 26 years.

Times are bad. They've been worse before. Honestly we're back to baseline from before the pandemic. _It's fine_.

Let's look at software engineering.

Graph doesn't go back as far and looks very scary. But look closely. It's only a little worse than _during the pandemic stock crash_.

We are fine.

## Ok but times _feel_ bad, what do I do?

**Build something**.

Yep that's the answer. Just do shit! Don't sit around spamming resumes to every inbox. Pick a problem that annoys you and start building. See if you can make a little business.

Nothing beats a body of work you can talk about.

Don't build portfolio projects. Do real work. It doesn't have to be fancy, but do have a goal other than "build something to show". The showing is secondary. [Your score takes care of itself](https://swizec.com/blog/the-score-takes-care-of-itself/).

Delivering small results ladders you up to bigger opportunities.

There was a saying back in 2008 that _"Startups come from people who feel undervalued by the market"_. If you're feeling underemployed or struggling to find something, that's the best time to start your own. What else are you gonna do?

Tough markets are a [great time to join startups](https://swizec.com/blog/place-good-startup-bets/). You're already feeling underpaid, might as well get a huge lottery ticket and fun challenging work to go with that feeling.

And never forget that [being exposed to fun challenging work](https://swizec.com/blog/why-take-a-bigger-role-for-no-bump-in-pay/) is how you learn the valuable stuff people pay for.

PS: freelancing can be a good first business. When I was starting, almost nobody hired full-time. Freelance contracts only
