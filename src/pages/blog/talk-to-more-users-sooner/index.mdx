Here's a fun lesson. Sharing while it's fresh.

Last week we built a new feature. Updated how a visualization works. It's now obvious when your plasmid DNA has 2 of a thing.

Internally this caused debate. Does it look like a bug? Will people get confused? Should you ever have 2 of a thing? Usually there's 1 of the thing. This is weird.

A few of us said _"Ship and find out"_.

We shipped, made a video, and shared on twitter. Tweeting things we work on is a new experiment for us. This is our 4th.

The only comment we got was _"omg thank you! I'm working on plasmids with 2+ of a thing!!"_.

You gotta ship to find out what's working. Ship, measure, adjust. Focus on the problem, not the solution. [Build products, not projects](https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-inspired/).

This is what [get us over the water, not build us a bridge](https://swizec.com/blog/get-us-over-the-water-not-build-us-a-bridge/) is about. The goal is to focus on the customer and their needs. The more feedback you can get faster, the better.
