## Intuitive distance

First let's talk a little bit about how all of us think of optimizing our paths for distance. You've probably noticed bits of grass so destroyed around the corners of walkways in parks that eventually the walkways are just expanded with rounded corners. Some architects are even so smart as to design them this way in the first place! This is due to how [right triangles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") work. The rule is basically that for any right triangle the length of the hypotenuse will necessarily be shorter than the sum of its catheti.

You can quickly check this is true with the first [pythagorean triplet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple "Pythagorean triple") (3,4,5). Obviosly 5 is less than 3+4. Far from a rigorous proof, but the idea isn't stupid. This is something that comes very intuitively to us. See a right triangle and choose to walk diagonally, it's simply shorter that way. It's even more obvious when you think about it in terms of distance traveled versus displacement. The [shortest path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem "Shortest path problem") to take between two points will always be one that best fits displacement.

## [Taxicab Geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry "Taxicab geometry")

All of this comes crashing to a halt in large american cities. Those tend to be laid out in a grid, and prevent us from traveling over proper [diagonals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal "Diagonal"). Instead we follow diagonals to our best abilities alongside a grid. [Herman Minkowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski") stipulated in the 19th century that because of this constraint, the distance traveled diagonally is no different than the distance traveled on any other gridded path with the same displacement. By looking at the sketch, I think we can all agree with Minkowski.

## Distance as a parameter of cost
