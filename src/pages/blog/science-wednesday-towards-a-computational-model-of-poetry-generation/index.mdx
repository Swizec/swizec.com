1.  why!?
2.  what makes it hard
3.  how it used to be done
4.  how it should be done

Obviously my idea of how it should be done matches somewhat with the authors of this paper, otherwise I wouldn't hold it in such a high regard :P

## Why!?

> Poetry is a unique artifact of human [natural language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") pro- duction, with the distinctive feature of having a strong unity between its content and its form. The creation of poetry is a task that requires intelligence, expert mastery over world and linguistic knowledge, and creativity. Al- though some researchwork has been devoted towards cre- ative language such as story generation, poetry writing has not been afforded the same attention. It is the aim of this research to fill that gap, and to shed some light on what often seems to be the most enigmatic andmysterious forms of [artistic expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art").

In short, this is a really cool problem to solve because it's something that hasn't _really_ been done before. And it just looks interesting when you give computers - strictly logical reasonable machines - even the most modest of abilities to create art. When rationalization is required ... well somebody needs to create all those pop songs. Imagine if we could get a computer to write them, then sell them to all the [pop music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music") labels to feed to the Spears and Aguileras of this world. Marvelous!

## What makes it hard

## How it used to be done

## How it should be done

![English: Jim Morrison in 1970.](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Jim_Morrison_19702.jpg "English: Jim Morrison in 1970.")

1.  Generate
2.  [Evaluate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation "Evaluation")

Generation is done by mutating the best candidates from the previous cycle through three simple constructs: Adding, Changing and Deleting. So if you had a verse _"John walked"_ it could become _"John walked **to the store**"_, or _"John **lumbered**"._ Or for instance _"John likes Jill and Mary_" it becomes _"John likes Jill"_. Because of an integrated architecture (combining all of semantics, form, etc.) these changes can and should happen at any level so special care must be taken that changing the semantics of a verse, doesn't negatively affect its rhythm. Although from the paper I don't grok why exactly this is a problem, since the evaluation step should take care of negative mutations. After we have a new population, these are then evaluated for correctness and the candidates with highest scores from the [fitness functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function "Fitness function") get to go into the next round of mutations. The authors go into little detail about assessing the different poetic structures, mostly because they have not yet cracked how to implement all of them. Detecting rhythm seems to be where they've made the most progress and a solution is suggested where we give the algorithm a target [phonetic form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_form "Phonetic form"), like this _limerick_:

```undefined
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s(a)
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s(a)
  w,s,w,w,s(b)
  w,s,w,w,s(b)
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s(a)
```

Where _w_ means a weak stress syllable and _s_ means a strong one. In parentheses the rhyming structure is described. It is suggested that with the exception figurative language all the criteria can be dumbed down to numerical arguments that can be easily quantified through different means that are only loosely described. They also go into a bit of formal detail explaining the sort of grammars that are used, but you should go read the actual paper if you're interested in such heavily theoretical things :) Here is an example of what their algorithm can produce: **Target semantics**

```undefined
{john(1),mary(2), dog(3), bottle(4), love(5,6,7), slow(8), smile(9,10)}
```

**Target Form**

```undefined
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s,
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s
```

**Surface**

```undefined
the bottle was loved by Luke
a bottle was loved by a dog
```

**Stress**

```undefined
w,s,w,w,s,w,s,
w,s,w,w,s,w,w,s
```
