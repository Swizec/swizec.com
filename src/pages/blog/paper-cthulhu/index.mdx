A [link](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=ACP/submode=ACP_news/\\) has been given me through MSN. A very interesting [link](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=ACP/submode=ACP_news/\\) at that. It supposedly guards the secret to making a Cthulhu out of paper complete with cutouts and vague instructions, just like you&#x27;d want. The only problem is that the images aren&#x27;t high resolution so the outcome isn&#x27;t looking too rosey.
