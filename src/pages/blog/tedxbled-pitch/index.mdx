[TEDxBled](https://www.facebook.com/TEDxBled) is right around the corner and it's accepting random people to come give a talk. There's a competition going on and out of everyone who submits a video they'll pick the best two to come dazzle the audience.

Since this is a pretty cool opportunity and I almost have something worthwhile to say I decided to pitch a talk about my [giving your future self a voice](https://swizec.com/blog/a-message-from-your-future-self-2/ "A message from your future self") idea. It's nowhere near the high level of altruism and awesomeness of [the other ideas pitched so far](http://challengefuture.org/quick/32), but hey ... we can't all be spectacular right?

Talking into a computer is insanely weird for me, I prefer a crowd - it's somehow easier, probably because I can feel for a connection, get a few cheap laughs and generally feel how I'm doing and whether I should change the pace around or whatever.

After a few takes I came up with this:

The voice is crappy, the lighting sucks because you can't see my face well, but if I tried going for a different shot I'd have to clean my room and that just sounds too much like an excuse to avoid studying for exams.

It's a long shot and I probably won't be asked to present, but at least I tried :)
