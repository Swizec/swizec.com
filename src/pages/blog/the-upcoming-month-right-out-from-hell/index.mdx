That is correct, the exam season is upon us once again. It&#x27;s going to be a hellish few weeks and I&#x27;m already dreading climbing out of bed each and every day respectfully. Horrible horrible times are afoot. This week I&#x27;m facing two midterms, one somewhat long paper and having to defend my homework before scrutiny. Next week it&#x27;s three rather not very easy exams. Yikes! And then nobody knows! I fully expect the one exam that&#x27;s scheduled and the three oral exams partaining to the exams that are next week. Hoorah! Oh well, the exam season will behave like the drunk daddy in a particular song methinks.
