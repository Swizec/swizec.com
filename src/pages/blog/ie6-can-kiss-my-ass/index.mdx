Yet again I&#x27;ve been asked to make a site work with IE6 and it&#x27;s just fucking stupid that they ask of me to waste that much time on something as stupid. You don&#x27;t ask an engineer to make a hydrogen car run on petrol just because petrol is around where people buy the car. You don&#x27;t ask an engineer to make a diesel locomotive run on steam just because the owner has a bunch of wood to burn. You don&#x27;t ask the whole world to write documents only in notepad because you&#x27;re too lazy to install Office.  
  
For the love of god people, I don&#x27;t give a fuck about an OLD browser. There&#x27;s a new version and it&#x27;s been out for TWO FUCKING years! If you still haven&#x27;t bloody updated then it&#x27;s your own fucking fault if the internet doesn&#x27;t work for you.  
  
Next time my boss asks me to support IE6 I&#x27;m gonna tell them I won&#x27;t do it and if they want it done they can just find somebody else to do it. Hell, I could get a better paying, but more stressful and farther away from home, job in a matter of days ... if they don&#x27;t like my work, fine.  
  
  
  
They don&#x27;t ask the designers to do their designs in MSPaint, so why should I be asked to do my work in an antique? If they (my boss) can go a week using only software from 2k1 and before then I&#x27;ll gladly support IE6.
