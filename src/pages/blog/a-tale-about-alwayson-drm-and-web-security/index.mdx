[![Diablo characters (I&#x27;m the guy with the shield)](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-characters.png "Diablo characters (I&#x27;m the guy with the shield)")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2013-03-diablo-characters.png) Two days ago I was at a friend&#x27;s place and wanted to show her what [Diablo 3](http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/?rhtml=y "Diablo III") looks like. She shows me minecraft, I show her Diablo. Everyone&#x27;s happy. But nope. I run Diablo, I mash in my password because of _course_ you have to log in to play a game with yourself. What could possibly be more natural ... but okay, maybe I don&#x27;t want my cat to mess with my characters and Blizzard doesn&#x27;t want me stealing their game. Fair enough.

> &quot;Oh hai thar! We noticed some suspicious activity on your account so we decided you have to verify you&#x27;re you via [Battle.net](http://www.battle.net/ "Battle.net"). Here&#x27;s a link to get you going&quot;

Really? All I did was try to login from a different IP. I&#x27;m at a friend&#x27;s place damn it, this is a laptop, what if I wanted to play in a coffee shop or on a plane or a pterodactyl? Sigh, fine ... I click the link expecting I&#x27;ll just have to login on Battle.net so they can confirm I also know how to login with a browser and supposedly am not hacking. Tap tap tap.

> &quot;So, you want to give us some digits of a physical copy of a game even though the only game associated with your account is a digital-only copy of Diablo? Or do you want to try answering your [secret question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_authentication "Knowledge-based authentication")?&quot;

Well crap, this isn&#x27;t just about logging in. I have just been forced to reset my password via a security question _just because I tried to play a game at a friend&#x27;s place!_ I try once. I try twice. I try three times. Nothing. This can happen when you choose random [security questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_question "Security question") and don&#x27;t always answer truthfully because, you know, social engineering. Usually I just mash my hand over the keyboard.

> &quot;You have made too many attempts! Your account is now locked! Contact support.&quot;

Oh okay! Right. I&#x27;m using the wrong account! I used _swizec@swizec.com_ for the Diablo3 beta, then was unable to recover it when I wanted the full game. The real account is _swizec+battle@swizec.com_ Let&#x27;s try again. A few attempts later ... OH! The security question is different on this account. Fuck me. Yay, I&#x27;m in! After two round-trips via email, countless attempts at answering the security question, numerous fiddles with the password to get them all matching and fitting the security rules I am finally in. That&#x27;s it. No _Hey thanks_, no, _You can go game now_, just a cold account dashboard. Close tab. Run game. Log in.

> &quot;Your password is incorrect&quot;

Oh for fuck&#x27;s sake! I mistyped my password ... twice ... consistently enough that they matched. \[caption id=&quot;attachment_6093&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;720&quot;][![Diablo massacre](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-massacre.png "Diablo massacre")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2013-03-diablo-massacre.png) Diablo massacre\[/caption] Sigh, now how do I change my password?

> &quot;Okay, just give us your old password and you can change it&quot;

But I don&#x27;t know the old password! Log out. Reset password. _&quot;You have made too many attempts! Your account is locked! Contact support.__&quot;_ Oh fuck me. Fine. I will contact support because this is getting silly and I am fed up with you mr. Battle.net! Clicky clicky through tens of questions trying to divert me from contacting a real person and making me solve my own problems. I battle it through like a champ and finally reach three options: Submit ticket, live chat, phone call. Live chat and phone call are currently offline. Well okay, it _is_ midnight and you are the European Blizzard support people so you&#x27;re probably sleeping. Fine. I click Submit ticket.

> &quot;Please login to your Battle.net account to submit tickets&quot;

__ARGH! I threw the computer out the window and cried myself to sleep. Ok, in reality I carefully put the computer away after slamming it shut ever so gently, it&#x27;s new you know, and watched a movie or something with my friend. Screw Diablo. Next day I got home and unlocked my account without a fuss. No hint of too many attempts, no complaints about suspicious activity. Nothing. Just worked. I&#x27;m confused. Yesterday my account was hacked and Terrible Things (tm) were going on, today everything is fine and you don&#x27;t even warn me that a crazy amount of stupid was happening last night? Right ...
