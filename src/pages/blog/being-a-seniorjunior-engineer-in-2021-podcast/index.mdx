Last week I went on the [PodRocket podcast](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/swizec) to talk about engineering careers, serverless handbook, and the current job market. We talked about why it's ice cold for new entrants, and flaming hot for experienced folk. ü§î

A reader liked it so much he emailed:

> just finished podcast with you! Was great, lots of great thoughts. When you talked about juniors, I've realized, there's probably room for "Juniors mindset" series as well :)
