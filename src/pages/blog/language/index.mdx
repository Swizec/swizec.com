After my third cup of tea in twenty minutes I was still wasted. Emacs staring me down, terminal blaring with test failures, social networks bleeping and blapping for attention, coworkers daring to make sounds. Music was annoying. _&quot;for starters just make a collection and write some tests&quot;_, I wrote down in my notebook. I stared at the words for five minutes. I knew what I wanted to do. I knew how to do it. I couldn&#x27;t do it. I just sat there, staring at those 10 words. _&quot;Lollobrigida&quot;_, a tiny voice in the back of my mind whispered.  So I put them on. I fell in love with Lollobrigida at last year&#x27;s EXIT festival. The energetic stage performance, sexy vocals and funny lyrics in a language I only used to know from jokes won me over. In the next few hours I banged out two new features from scratch. Alone in my world with only Emacs and Lollobrigida for company the world could be crumbling around me and I wouldn&#x27;t notice. ![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7sfFwonuTcC5KdBhmcBP) Lollobrigida wasn&#x27;t English. That&#x27;s all it took. Something not-English blasting in my ears. I&#x27;m not one to shy away from using English, after all I&#x27;ve been writing this blog in English for years, the books I&#x27;m writing are English, most of my Twitter posts are English, even the online forum I&#x27;ve been a part of for 8 years is English. Hell, anyone who knows me will tell you the language I usually speak is a mix between English and Slovenian. When I can&#x27;t think of a word in one language I&#x27;ll simply use the other. I often begin my sentences in Slovenian and switch to English half-way through because it flows better or expresses a concept better. A favourite drinking game in my group of friends is banning English from the conversation. It&#x27;s pretty brutal. But here in the US I can&#x27;t do that. These four weeks mark the longest streak I&#x27;ve ever had of using only one language. There&#x27;s simply nobody around who speaks Slovenian. It&#x27;s tiring. When I talk and a word doesn&#x27;t immediately come to mind, I can&#x27;t just switch to a different language, I have to stop and think until a synonym comes to mind or somebody helps me out. I always have to be vigilant about what I&#x27;m saying because when I&#x27;m tired and we&#x27;re just hanging out, I often almost say something Slovenian, bite my tongue midway through and say it in English. I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s noticed though. If they have, they haven&#x27;t mentioned it. But Lollobrigida relaxed my brain, even though it&#x27;s in Croatian - a language I was convinced I didn&#x27;t know until last year I suddenly realised it&#x27;s actually rather understandable. The trips to Serbia and then Croatia and Bosnia and in winter again Bosnia and then Serbia confirmed that, yup, I understand the language. Can almost speak it now. No idea where or how I learned, but it seems to relax my brain just because it&#x27;s much more similar to Slovenian than English, even though English is far more familiar. Strange. Considering how second nature English is to me and how much I use it every day, I would never have thought using it exclusively could be a problem. But there you go. The problems almost-bilinguals face ...
