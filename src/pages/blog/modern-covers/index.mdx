Last night I came across yet another song that I thought was awesome, but turned out to be a cover of an 80&#x27;s electropop or synthpop or electronica or whatever the genre song. Really, too many way too similar genres in the 80&#x27;s, bloody annoying. Anyhoo ...

What strikes me as odd is that all covers I find are better than their electropop originals, which is vastly different to modern covers of 80&#x27;s rock music that are usually much worse and simply not as good in any way. Usually modern rock covers lack a certain emotion behind them, while the old electropop music seems to lack the emotion behind the modern interpretations.

Take [Eurhythmics&#x27; Sweet Dreams](http://youtube.com/watch?v=OufZbzsUtIo), sure cool song, nice to listen, but utterly annoying in the way it&#x27;s done. Now take [Marylin Manson&#x27;s cover](http://youtube.com/watch?v=3iuve2OjY_8) of the same song and you will notice it has much more feeling behind it, sounds better and just feels much more suited to the lyrics. [Fear for Tears&#x27; Mad World](http://youtube.com/watch?v=4NAPw8N5vM8) is a similar example, the original doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the depressing lyrics at all and is very silly in its appearance, while the [Michael Andrews/Gary Jules version](http://youtube.com/watch?v=v52Igdotisk) is perfectly suited for the lyrics, slow depressing and awesome sounding.

The most interesting difference I see is that the modern version as a rule have a slower tempo, deeper, more sensual voice and simpler music, much simpler. Is it just the times that change so much, the overall preferences in people&#x27;s taste or is it just that 80&#x27;s synthpop simply wasn&#x27;t good music?
