Your teacher puts down a trashcan at the front of the class.

_"Ok class, crumple up a piece of paper and throw it in the bin from where you are"_

You can stand up, climb on your chair, even your desk. Your ball can be loose or crumpled hard, light paper or heavy. But you can't leave your spot.

Ball in trash is an A. Rim is B, side of can is C, everyone else gets an F.

Thatâ€™s equality as it works today. Something feels unfair ðŸ¤”

In life there are no guarantees and that's okay. _Guaranteeing_ success wouldn't be fair either.

But you have to understand we're all running a different race.

Some of us ran a marathon to start the sprint. Others have a broken leg or wind in their face. Yet others get 3 extra balls to throw at that stupid trashcan.

You play the cards you have, not the cards you wish you had. Help others play theirs.

Cheers,<br/>
