\__![Data Points](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/5479666205_e74e748bf0_m3.jpg "Data Points")![]()![]()_![]()![]()\_![]()![]()

1.  Smoothen data with a [rolling average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average "Moving average") (a 7 day window seems to produce the nicest curve)
2.  The first unknown [data point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point "Data point") is simply the [expected value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") (weighed average) of the last few points
3.  Expand weighed average window to include the new data point
4.  Calculate next one
5.  Repeat for as long as it makes sense - the more into the future you go, the more wrong you are

After reading a bunch of papers on data mining time series yesterday I realized that I'm thinking way too much into this. Sure [SVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine "Support vector machine")'s are the best at predicting financial time series and people have extremely good results with backpropagation neural networks - somehow - but I honestly don't need this complexity. I'm just making a simple tool for myself and it's more important to have _some_ result than the _optimal_ result. And either way, according to the papers a neural network is only marginally better than the [sliding window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol "Sliding window protocol") approach, and even then only when you're dealing with data when far-away points have a lot of impact on the future and/or there is a lot of repetition - none of which happens here.
