- fetches toshl and toggl data
- runs a simple [machine learning algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning")
- sends me an email along the lines of _Hey dude, you're gonna run out of money in two weeks. Just thought I'd mention that_

Yesterday I made the fetching part in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") - a surprisingly difficult task when there's no ready-made Toggl library and Toshl doesn't even have an official API - and I'm tackling the learning bit today ... perhaps even in [Haskell](http://haskell.org "Haskell (programming language)"). That should be interesting and couldn't possibly fail right? Oh and if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to reverse engineer an API from web forms make sure to send the _'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'_ header. Wasted at least an hour trying to figure out why my requests worked perfectly with Curl but not in Node.js. Of course it also helps if your target doesn't have csrf protection; thanks for that Toshl team. You guys are awesome :) PS: ping me if you think this sort of service could be useful to you too
