> Need girl. 170cm, blonde, 34D. Must love discussing astrophysics, philosophy, and mobile startups. Opinions on node.js vs. io.js a plus. 4 year degree or higher. Must enjoy fast cars, watching Netflix, and should understand why sprinklers have to be off at 3:32am every third Tuesday of the month. Dr. Who appreciation a plus. Will get free dinners, walks on the beach, and skydiving lessons in return. Subsidised travel when appropriate.

Ridiculous, right? And yet, that&#x27;s what a lot job ads for software engineers look like. The better ones will turn it around and take the _We offer more than we take!_ approach. They highlight the perks and attach a strong brand. Deep down, they&#x27;re the same. The more proactive companies hire legions of recruiters to send generic emails to everyone with a pulse. Some better some worse. But here&#x27;s the thing - software engineering jobs are a total seller&#x27;s market right now. Every engineer you&#x27;d want to hire has already got a job. Or their own company. Or they&#x27;re still in school. You might get lucky with those still in school. They&#x27;re juniors and don&#x27;t know much about the industry. But you will scare them away with that list of requirements. And you&#x27;d have to train them anyway. Those with a company ... well you can get those. But only when their company isn&#x27;t doing well. Or has just folded. You have to get lucky to catch them on a downturn - when they&#x27;re disheartened. But if they&#x27;ve got a VC funded company, you will have to acquihire. Those are expensive. So you&#x27;re left with engineers who currently have a job. Those fall into two categories. Employed and happy, and employed and unhappy. You&#x27;re going to be hard pressed to convince somebody who&#x27;s already happy. Changing one&#x27;s entire work environment is stressful so people avoid it. And they will have little job satisfaction before they fully grok your codebase. Your offer will have to be absolutely _stellar_. The kind of offer I&#x27;m talking about usually isn&#x27;t. Now, there&#x27;s the engineers who are unhappy in their current job. These will be easier to convince, but it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;re going to see your ad. And even then, they are still coming from a position of strength. Disregarding you doesn&#x27;t cost them a thing. The upside will still have to be pretty good. What I wonder is, _why_ do you look for engineers like this? By scaring away the only people who might sign up on their own? According to a measure I&#x27;ve heard once (probably depends on many factors), a new full-time engineer adds some $1,000,000 to your company&#x27;s sell value. They&#x27;re going to cost you some $300,000 over the two or three years they stay with you, and if all goes well, are going to _enable_ your revenue production. A few million for sure. As a business person, would you look for million dollar clients with a generic _&quot;Have business. Need $1MM in sales. Please apply&quot;_ ad? Of course you wouldn&#x27;t. You&#x27;d network like mad, ask everyone for leads, take prospective leads to fancy dinners, write personalised proposals, buy expensive gifts. Etc. Why don&#x27;t you approach engineers the same way? I promise we&#x27;ll take you seriously if you feed us and spend an hour explaining how we can help.
