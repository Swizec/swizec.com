## Barely scratching the surface

You might think html and css are that simple thing anyone can do ... that they're just something everyone is born with at least a functioning knowledge of. But here's the truth, _that shit is **hard**._ And that's not even getting into nginx servers, caching, http protocols, MVC backends, MVC frontends, databases, event-based stuff, multithreading and so on and on ad nauseum. The average web developer's brain contains so much knowledge it's absolutely mindboggling! ... and a lot of companies want to pay them peanuts, because hey, that neighbour kid "does websites" and he'd do it for free.
