```octave
J = 0;
for i = 1:m
  J += =y(i)*log(sigmoid(theta*X(i,:))-(1-y(i)*log(1-sigmoid(theta*X(i,:));
end

J = J/m;

for j = 1:size(theta)
   grad(j) = 0;
   for i = 1:m
      grad(j) += (sigmoid(theta*X(i,:))-y(i))*X(i,j);
   end
   grad(j) = grad(j)/m;
end
```

But all those lops aren't really necessary, all they are basically doing is [matrix multiplication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication"), which gives us a nice way to vectorize the whole thing:

```octave
J = (1/m)*sum(-y'*log(sigmoid(X*theta))-(1-y')*log(1-sigmoid(X*theta)));

grad = (1/m)*(sigmoid(X*theta)-y)'*X;
```

The difference in elegance absolutely blows my mind and I can't wait to see what other wonders I discover through this Octave thing in the course of this semester. Pretty much all my octave can be found in the [ml-class-homework repository](https://github.com/Swizec/ml-class-homework). But I'm sure I'll end up modeling more algorithms in this thing.
