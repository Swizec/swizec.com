More and more UI frameworks are ditching JSON as the transfer protocol and going back to server-rendered markup injected into your app. React has Server Components, HTMX and Hotwire embrace hyper-text, Remix is launching an iframes-based approach at their conf later this month, and TanStack is going for an SPA-on-top-of-SSR approach that I really like.

I talked about this at Commit Your Code in Dallas. Using incremental rewrites as the excuse. With live demos ðŸ¤˜

Check it out, let me know what you think. The HTMX approach has been great for us when modernizing existing Jinja+jQuery UI that we don't want to fully rewrite from scratch. React Islands for stuff that needs to be super interactive. TanStack for interactive things that need to look pretty on first paint.
