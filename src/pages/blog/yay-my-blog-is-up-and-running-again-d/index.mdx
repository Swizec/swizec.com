Now this is the story all about how My blog got flipped, turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I fucked it all up so damn well

In West Apache born and raised On the playground where it spent most of his days Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool And all serving some blabber outside of the school When a couple of admins said 'we're up in no good' Started making trouble in my neighbourhood I forgot one little date and my blog got scared And said 'you're moving with your aunt and uncle in nginx'

I begged and pleaded with them the other day But they packed my suitcase and sent me on my way They gave me a kissin' and they gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it

First class, yo this is bad, Drinking errors juice out of a config glass Is this what the people of nginx
