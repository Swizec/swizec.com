What's the core purpose of your job? To write the code?

Nope. To code yourself out of a job.

We talked about this with Robby Russell on his [Maintainable Podcast](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/swizec-teller-sr-engineer-mindset) – your goal is to write code in a way that others can maintain it, learn from it, and make it better.

Because when you think about it, if you're stuck keeping today's code alive, how will you ever have time to reach for bigger better challenges?

You don't have to build code that lasts forever. That's impossible. Everything needs maintenance. But does it have to be _your_ maintenance?

The worst code is code only you can maintain. Read [The Story of Mel](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html) for a fantastic cautionary tale of a genius coder.

[On the podcast](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/swizec-teller-sr-engineer-mindset) we also talked about technical debt, balancing speed and quality, growing fast as a startup, and about the [Serverless Handbook for frontend engineers](https://serverlesshandbook.dev).

Enjoy ❤️
