On March 26th I giddily said [it takes about two months to write a technical book](http://swizec.com/blog/it-takes-about-two-months-to-write-a-technical-book/swizec/6076). Still high from the recent success it seemed like the thing to do. \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;264&quot;]![Hemingway writing](http://images.elephantjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-359.png "Hemingway writing") Hemingway writing\[/caption] It is now May 9th. I am [editing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing "Film editing"). Well, sort of. I had thought my writing was awesome, that there will be hardly any editing needed and on 9th of April, just two weeks later, there was a reality check in my inbox. It was the editor: &quot;Hey this is really great, solid writing, I just fixed some spelling and markup for ya.&quot; And truly, all the fixes were either typos or [British English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") - they want American. Something about markets. &quot;Oh and shorten the book by 60 pages. We said 100, you wrote 180, we can do 120 tops.&quot; _\*gulp\*_ It is now May 9th. I am editing. The stickler is that my beta readers said they&#x27;d like even _more_ content in the book, definitely not less. Obviously I can&#x27;t cut any content out of the book and I can&#x27;t make the code examples shorter either. People have already complained the examples are a bit terse and hard to understand at moments. I could take out some screenshots, but this is a book about creating shiny visualisations for the internet. Screenshots must stay. Only thing left is the writing. I have to go through the whole book and use less words to say more. _\*gulp\*_ Facing such a monumental task it is therefore not a surprise I&#x27;ve only spent about 30 hours editing my book in the last month. That&#x27;s averaging just an hour per day - the average for writing was two and a half. And editing time isn&#x27;t even half as efficient as writing time. For every two minutes of staring bleary eyed at the screen, dragging the words through my mind like so much barbed wire, I spend five minutes prancing about on the internet feeling like I&#x27;m riding a unicorn in comparison. Editing really is sheer drudgery. There is no flow. There is no inspiration. Just a constant ruthless cutting and rewording. All those little things you thought added a special flair to the writing, let your personality shine through, entertained the reader. Waste. Plain old waste. Vomit of a writer who&#x27;s been staring at the screen too long. It all has to go. And the writing is _much_ better for it. But you&#x27;re still sad to see it all go. Actually, not so much sad, as indifferent. You don&#x27;t feel anything but the monotonous drudgery of rewriting something you&#x27;ve already written and not coming up with anything new. You can&#x27;t, add something new and the word count goes up not down. Can&#x27;t have that! It&#x27;s been fairly successful too. I&#x27;ve finished the first two chapters. One cut down from 14 to 9 pages, the other from 51 to 40. Just by improving the writing. No loss of content. But it&#x27;s just so ... it&#x27;s terrible. This weekend I discovered a trick, though. I was at a friend&#x27;s place and as I was editing in the kitchen I realized that the chairs are terrible and the table is the wrong height. Peeved, I moved to the counter. Editing standing next to the kitchen counter, shoulders slouched to stare at the screen ... ... before I knew it, two hours had passed and I edited five pages of text. Amazing! I had fallen into flow. _Editing!_ Flow! I don&#x27;t actually know if this was because of my friend&#x27;s kitchen or because I was standing while writing. But I&#x27;m going to repeat the experiment today. Fingers crossed it works!
