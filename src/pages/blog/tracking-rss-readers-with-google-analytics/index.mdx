[![XKCD nerd sniping](./img/comics-nerd_sniping.png "XKCD nerd sniping")](http://xkcd.com) The problem with [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS "RSS") (aside from only being used by nerds) is that it is almost untrackable. Sure there&#x27;s [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/ "FeedBurner") and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics "Google Analytics") can tell you how many people came to your blog specifically through clickthroughs. But when you&#x27;ve got the whole post right there in your reader, why would you ever want to clickthrough to the actual website? You wouldn&#x27;t. Feedburner tells me there are 925 people subscribed to my blog. Hooray! Do they ever read a post? No idea. Well, about 400 a month do clickthrough to the website ... but who cares about that. I&#x27;m not an advertiser, all I want are readers! On Tuesday I nerdsniped myself and spent the whole day trying to figure out how to do this - long story short, I didn&#x27;t find a single way. But I tried several things:

## \_\_utm.gif

If you didn&#x27;t know, Google Analytics uses a so called [tracking pixel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug "Web bug")that a javascript snippet injects into a site so it can then be downloaded by the browser. Because the gif is dynamically served by a server and there are a bunch of parameters in the request - they know who you are, what the site was, and voila - tracking! \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; caption=&quot;Wikibooks-javascript (Photo credit: Wikipedia)&quot;][![Wikibooks-javascript](./img/wikipedia-commons-thumb-8-80-Wikibooks-javascript.png-300px-Wikibooks-javascript.png "Wikibooks-javascript")](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wikibooks-javascript.png)\[/caption] Add it to the feed with the right parameters and voila. You suddenly know how many people _read_ your [RSS feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS "RSS")! Hooray \\o/ Well ... no. Apparently Google Analytics ignore such requests. The referrer is probably wrong since it isn&#x27;t your domain, just some sort of reader url or something.

## [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript")

Maybe the parameters I added to the \_\_utm.gif request weren&#x27;t dynamic enough. The cookie stuff was certainly missing ... Okay, let&#x27;s use [Google&#x27;s](http://google.com "Google") own javacript snippet. Surely _that_ will work! I mean, what could possibly go wrong, a reader loads your article as html anyway, so javascript should definitely work. And I&#x27;m fairly sure I&#x27;ve seen javascript in certain feeds ... how else would those ads get in there? Nope. Readers scrape away all traces of javascript, probably worried about hacking and silly stuff.

## Iframes

Right, [iframes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element "HTML element") then! Everything should work perfectly - the tracking pixel is inserted with javascript, the iframe actually loads your website so surely all the other parameters are correct as well. Better yet, [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/ "Slashdot")&#x27;s got an iframe in their feed and _that_ works! Youtube embeds and others are also a combination of iframes and javascript. Surely we&#x27;re on to a winner here. I even went so far as to make a special iframe-only look for my blog: That&#x27;s right, add a _?track_page=1_ to a [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") and you get a bunch of sharing widgets and google analytics. Let&#x27;s make the iframe useful why not ... Didn&#x27;t work. Readers allow iframes on a per-case basis and apparently I&#x27;m not cool enough for them.

## Well, poo

I&#x27;m very open to ideas for things to try here ... all I want is to look at google analytics and have people reading the RSS counted amonst the normal reader population. Sure, Feedburner does have some sort of hack to look at &quot;reach&quot;, but it bugs me that I have no idea what that actually means. And that it&#x27;s not included where I normally look for stats.
