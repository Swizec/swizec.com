## A lot of bugs!

![]()![English: British Army Signals Trials Unit test...](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/300px-Army_Camp-sml.jpg "English: British Army Signals Trials Unit test...")

1.  change code
2.  commit to _develop branch_
3.  switch to _staging branch_
4.  merge develop branch into staging
5.  push to github
6.  change to other terminal window
7.  pull from staging branch
8.  restart python processes
9.  go to Stripe dashboard
10. pick customer
11. create invoice item
12. create actual invoice
13. choose invoice
14. _pay_ invoice
15. go to Stripe logs
16. find _invoice.payment_succeeded_ webhook
17. scroll down to response
18. look through raw html of django's error page
19. find symptom
20. GOTO 1.

That's right, a whopping _20 step_ debug cycle all because I'm an idiot and couldn't find a way to automate this. Or maybe I was too tired to do the unobvious thing ... although I still don't want to split a 6 liner into two functions. With proper [unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing "Unit testing") the debug cycle would look like this:

1.  change code
2.  run tests
3.  symptom thrown in face
4.  GOTO 1.

Much lazier right? For the record, those six lines of code contained **4** bugs ->

- forgot to import a module
- different event data structure than I understood from the docs
- twice^
- misnamed variables from one line to another

Yes, all of those could _easily_ have been caught if my [test coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_coverage "Fault coverage") was actually any good! And then not only would I not look like an idiot in front of the client, I'd probably spend no more than ten minutes fixing this. Let this be a lesson both to you and to Future Swizec!
