Today I learned that Ljubljana has something awesome I simply couldn&#x27;t find in Palo Alto (I might not have been looking hard enough). We have a coffee culture.

In the evenings when it gets a bit cooler and you can actually breathe, people start crawling out of the woodwork and into the coffee shops all over town centre.

Having a cup of iced tea in the middle of this buzz, writing blogs and watching people just chill without being in a hurry ... it&#x27;s pretty cool for doing creative stuff. Much better than Palo Alto where everyone seems constantly in a hurry because they&#x27;re all startup people. Perhaps San Francisco has more of a chillaxed evening culture, but I got the impression in the US there&#x27;s more of a Saturday/Sunday brunch culture.

Another thing I learned is that jet lag can be an incredibly useful study aide. Turns out it&#x27;s much easier to pull an all nighter studying for an exam when it feels like mid afternoon.

Let&#x27;s just hope I don&#x27;t learn tomorrow that studying all night for an exam is counterproductive to passing said exam :)
