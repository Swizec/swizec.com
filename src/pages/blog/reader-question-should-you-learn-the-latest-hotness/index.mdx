_"should you focus on your company's tech stack or learn the latest hotness?"_ was an audience question at a fireside chat about [Senior Mindset](https://seniormindset.com) last night.

Great question. Common concern. _What if I get stuck in a technology that isn't hot??_ Or worse, burn out re-learning every new thing üò±

Ideally you can [skate where the puck is going](https://swizec.com/blog/what-a-hockey-legend-can-teach-you-about-career-development/). Be proficient at the tools you're using now and get shit done. Keep an eye out for the future and look for opportunities that nudge you there.

Have a [vision for where you're going](https://swizec.com/blog/your-career-needs-a-vision/). That helps. What problems do you like solving? What tools do you need? Don't learn shit you won't use.

But here's a secret nobody told you:

Specific tools don't matter. The underlying problems are all the same.

The web is nothing special, neither is the blockchain stuff. Even the fancy-pants AI and machine learning algorithms need a product built around their innovative core.

It's a thin or fat client talking to a fat or thin data source over a network. "We" have been building systems like that since the 1950's.

Hell, modern _cars_ are a client talking to servers over a network (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

Learn these skills, they never go out of fashion and in the world of framework warriors they're surprisingly rare:

- data modeling
- domain modeling
- system design
- managing complexity
- syncing state
- teamwork
