Next week I'm giving a talk about `Scaling Fast: Engineering lessons learned from tech startups` at C3 Fest in Amsterdam. Decided to publish my notes because they look pretty useful on their own. Although I hope my stage presence adds a little something something. Enjoy :)

- hook: your users are going üèí¬†now what?
  - pic of a hockeystick graph
- you need to scale 3 things
  - business
  - team
  - tech
- scaling the business is simple, but hard
  - more sales
  - higher price
- beware the S-curve
  - pic of S-curve
  - every business hits a ceiling when growth and churn balance out
  - you then need to figure out something new
  - _linear_ growth (adding same N users per time unit) will never work long-term
- why this matters?
  - this is your fuel
  - CAC + LTV = salaries and all
- transition slide
  - gif of gromit laying track in front of train
  - while all this business stuff is happening, you‚Äôre trying to keep up with tech
- DONT BE THE BOTTLENECK
- scaling the team
  - like this (vertical teams), not like this (horizontal teams)
    - this is a sketchy sketch
  - different names for this concept
    - empowered teams
    - stream aligned teams
    - business capability centric teams
  - always the same goal ‚Äì¬†deliver value without being blocked
- a team should
  - own their destiny
  - own their mess
  - understand their domain
- Get us across the water, not build us a bridge
  - pic of empowered team
  - Involve engineers early, they understand the domain
  - Set goal, let team execute
  - you have lots of smart engineers, use them
- Delegate decisions, not just tasks
  - person closest to the problem knows best
  - it feels good to be needed, but you can‚Äôt scale if 1 person is the bottleneck
  - this goes fractally up and down the org
  - build trust, then start taking decisions off their plates
- work in progress kills your progress
  - obsess with getting things to done
  - measure PR time in minutes
  - merge straight to main
  - deploy many times per day
  - keep it all integrated
- large discussions in PR are way too late - collaborate early - agree on the design before you write the code - shift left!
- what about the tech?
  - in a way, tech is the easy part
  - 90% of the time you‚Äôre solving problems with known solutions
- don‚Äôt overthink the tech
  - the older I get, the more my code looks like a step-by-step recipe
  - use off-the-shelf solutions where possible
  - adapt to your tools rather than reinventing
  - save your innovation tokens for differentiators
- just solve the problem, not a different more difficult problem
  - biggest source of WIP and slow-downs is solving a bigger problem than you need
  - focus on what‚Äôs in front of you
  - aggressively cut anything that isn‚Äôt strictly required
  - make followup tickets
  - if any one requirement blows up complexity, push back
- be a good partner to product
  - you‚Äôre the inputter
  - they‚Äôre the decider
  - you know best when something is easy or super hard
  - push back and you‚Äôll be surprised how often the answer is ‚ÄúOh, not worth it then‚Äù
- prioritize architectural complexity
  - how your boxes connect matters more than how clean your boxes are
  - you can fix an isolated box
  - you can‚Äôt detangle a rat‚Äôs nest
- use vertical modules
  - like this, not like this (similar pic to earlier teams)
  - orient your code on the business domain
  - not on the tech it uses
  - what does it _do_? forget the how, that will change
  - you can call these services, microservices, modules in a monolith, components in the UI, internal libraries, or whatever else you want
  - doesn‚Äôt matter. Just keep them separate and use clear APIs!
- DRY is the root of much evil
  - better to have extra code you‚Äôll merge later
  - than to have diverging concepts that are tied at the hip
  - don‚Äôt entangle code just because it looks similar right now
- get your data right
  - "Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious." -- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month (1975)
  - "Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." -Linus Torvalds
  - code can come and go, but data is forever
  - the right data makes your code easy
  - the wrong data makes you do awful things in the code
- that‚Äôs why vertical teams and code!
  - when your teams own their destiny
  - they can design the data and the code to work together
  - no weird handoffs and APIs that don‚Äôt quite do what you need
- building software is like kicking a can
  - you‚Äôll never know exactly what you need until you try
  - product development is a cycle
  - fast feedback loops beat big up-front design
- only universal engineering rule
  - make it work
  - make it right
  - make it fast
  - first get something out there, when you know it‚Äôs doing the job clean it all up, then look for performance hotspots and fix those
- thanks
  - go here for book: boop

Cheers,<br/>
