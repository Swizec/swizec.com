[Claude Shannon](https://swizec.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5057005056_6c46df1beb_m.jpg)

Today I learned that quickreading scientific text isn't all that quick at all. I have a theoretical exam on [information theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) on Tuesday and to start off the studying I wanted to read [Shannon's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) original paper on the topic, all 55 pages of it.

Seeming as how quickreading is a little bit like opening a broadband pipeline from the text right into my brain ... well turns out quickreading 55 pages liberally sprinkled with [mathematical formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula) takes just over an hour. And I don't feel like I've gotten much out of reading the thing, certainly nothing more than I already had a grasp of studying for the practical part of the exam.

At least it was an interesting read.

Another thing I discovered today is that with the addition of a wireless keyboard, [the iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad) is in fact a useful device. Shocker!

After my laptop keyboard started spazzing out following the August Spill, I fired up Pages on the iPad and was well on the way ... except for the special [Slovene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language) letters because the iPad is oh so clever and you can't tell it to use a keyboard layout different than what the keyboard considers native.

Silly thing.
