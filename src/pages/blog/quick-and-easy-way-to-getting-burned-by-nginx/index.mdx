![HTTP 403: Forbidden](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2990635787_f61ba8ce93_m1.jpg "HTTP 403: Forbidden")![]()\_\_![]()

```undefined
server {
	listen 80;
        server_name hipstervision.org;
```

But on that particular site I had:

```undefined
server {
	listen my-ip:80;
        server_name something.something;
```

Not sure why that was the case, but apparently Nginx pushes all requests to the most specific _listen_ rule first and only worries about domains and server names later. Good to know!
