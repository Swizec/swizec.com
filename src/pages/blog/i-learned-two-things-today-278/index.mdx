Today I learned that [jet lag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_lag "Jet lag") is a much uglier beast than I ever anticipated. I don&#x27;t remember having this much trouble last time I came back from the US; perhaps because I wasn&#x27;t there for as long and the different timezone didn&#x27;t seep into my [sleep cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm "Circadian rhythm") as much? All week I&#x27;ve been getting up in the middle of the day and then being unable to fall asleep until insane morning hours (think 6 or 7am). This seems to throw my whole day into a tailspin, especially because the wakeup isn&#x27;t exactly nice and the sleep doesn&#x27;t leave me rested at all. As a result this whole week I&#x27;ve barely managed to stitch 30 productive hours together. Most of which came as the cram session for the Thursday exam. Sure hope this thing passes soon. Another thing I learned is that with the new OAuth2 [Foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com/ "Foursquare") API and teh awesomeness of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "JQuery") it is very _very_ simple to make a purely browser-side Foursquare client in javascript. This comes as a great breakthrough in the way everyone can develop web apps and I think is wroth some more exploration. The first thing I&#x27;m going to try is making the footer on my blog work again since it&#x27;s been turned off because it couldn&#x27;t handle the load. Anyone know of a ready-made library existing already? Of course making soem sort of distributed cache with minimal involvement from the server will be the real issue ... but definitely worth exploring.
