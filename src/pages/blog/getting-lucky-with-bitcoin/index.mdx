\[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;379&quot;]![Tasty tasty bitcoins](./img/images-4138.png "Tasty tasty bitcoins") Tasty tasty bitcoins\[/caption] In April I was implementing [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin") integration for a client and the more I read about how Bitcoin works, the more I liked it. So I decided to buy 200 euro worth of bitcoin on [Bitstamp](http://www.bitstamp.net/ "Bitstamp"). Mostly because I could upload money with a SEPA bank transfer. But also because they&#x27;re from Slovenia and if anything goes wrong, I can knock on their door and ask some questions. I had about 2.54 btc to play with. Naturally I wanted to do arbitrages and look at graphs all day and try to make money from selling when Bitcoin is high and buying when it&#x27;s low. Staking out the graphs, listening for the beeps a sale makes, twitchy fingers on the sell button ... ... I lost 50 euro in two days. Then another 20 or 30 by the end of the week. Better idea! I&#x27;ll write an algorithm to do this for me because I suck at it. Just before I started working on the algorithm I turned every dollar on the Bitstamp account into Bitcoin. Then promptly got busy with other stuff.

## Getting lucky

Every once in a while I would remember the poor project laying abandoned on my Github account. That I should really get back to it. That I could make a bunch of money if I made a high frequency or even a low frequency [trading algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading "Algorithmic trading") for bitcoins. Even just a semiautomatic system that finds the best buy/sell moment after I tell it to do something would be a great help. Oh the endless possibilities and infinite laziness in actually doing something about them. But time passed. Bitcoin did its thing. And yesterday morning it hit $588 per coin. Wait what? _&quot;Holy crap! I have to sell&quot;_, I thought to myself. I didn&#x27;t even think about the fact it would continue to grow before it crashes. I didn&#x27;t think about anything. I just sold. Bam. Some 2.15 bitcoin gone. Some $1200 made. \\o/ Pretty good return on investment if you ask me. Put $270 in, get $1200 out a few months later. 400% return, and I just wish I had put more money in. But the hell if I knew this was going to happen.

## Money isn&#x27;t money until it&#x27;s your money

But money&#x27;s not money until it hits your bank account. As great as Bitstamp is, a bank account it&#x27;s not. Withdrawing the money was greeted with a lovely _&quot;Ohai thar, we don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re a real human. Please verify your account by sending government issued ID and proof of residence.&quot;_ Didn&#x27;t need that to _take_ my money did you Bitstamp? Now suddenly it&#x27;s a big deal and I have to jump through hoops. But I understand. Bitstamp is a money instrument. They might have become more stringent in the last couple of months. As they should. I had to do all of this to get a UK credit card from [Skrill](http://www.skrill.com/ "Moneybookers") as well. Sent files through their form. No email confirmation that I sent the info, just account status changing from &quot;UNVERIFIED&quot; to &quot;PENDING&quot;. No estimate how long it would take. _sigh_ Bitstamp, you are not being very serious right now. Today I go to check up on my application and bask in the glory of that boldened \$1200 figure staring at me from the screen. Nope. Get a scary _&quot;We are fairly certain you are not a real person&quot;_ notice. Right from their cloud hosting too! Bitstamp going through a [DDoS attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack") of some sort. Or just being down. Or they don&#x27;t like me anymore. They came back online while I was writing this post, but man was that scary. Funny how attached you get to money that isn&#x27;t even your yet.
