Hulu is probably the staple of racist regional copyright restrictions in the world, but there are many others like Youtube in some cases, the iStore, BBC&#x27;s video player thingy where they release all their tv shows and probably many others. Now, out of those, the only one I can understand is BBC because they are paid from a tax on the people and everybody outside the UK doesn&#x27;t actually pay said tax and BBC is too lazy to figure out a different scheme for us. But onward to the issue. Have you ever seen any of these or something along these lines? \[gallery link=&quot;file&quot;] If you have seen those it means _someone_ was being racist (actually ethnicist) towards you and you should fight for your rights! Seriously! Now I realise most of those say that they&#x27;re only doing this due to some sort of contractual obligations and are working desperately towards making a customer out of you. But you know what, the only ones I&#x27;ve ever seen actually _do _something about it were SouthParkStudios - and that makes them supercool in my book. I don&#x27;t pirate South Park anymore because of that. The main reason why these sort of **regional copyright practices are bloody racist** is that:

1. &quot;Those other countries aren&#x27;t worthy of paying for our content&quot;
2. &quot;Oh those other people can watch shows [syndicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication "Broadcast syndication") two years behind the curve when all the jokes are stale and all event references are long gone&quot;
3. &quot;Our business model is so outdated we need to create [artificial scarcity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity "Artificial scarcity") to keep it up&quot;

And all of these racist presumptions they make are due simply to the fact the &quot;majors&quot; still haven&#x27;t figured out that with the advent of the internets there is no notion of country for what is essentially information. **We&#x27;re all citizens of the same world!** So I implore you dear reader, pirate, pirate and pirate some more everything and anything that they feel you are unworthy of being sold. And then pirate it some more! PS: please send this link onward if you agree, but especially if you don&#x27;t.
