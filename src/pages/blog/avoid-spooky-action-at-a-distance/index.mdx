[name|Friend] unclear state dependencies are the biggest source of code that's difficult to detangle.

So much so that [Shared State Bad](https://swizec.com/blog/my-favorite-lessons-from-pragmatic-programmer/) is a programming dogma described in books like Pragmatic Programmer and many others. But shared state is fine, even necessary, when done right. Let me explain.

One of my earliest big projects was a text-based GUI for [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS). I was 12 and called it an operating system because I didn't know any better. That project taught me an important lesson about shared state.

![Example of what text-based GUIs in DOS used to look like, image from Wikipedia](./img/Example-of-what-text-based-GUIs-in-DOS-used-to-look-like-image-from-Wikipediad51bh7.png)

I wrote the project in Turbo Pascal before learning about functions, procedures, arrays, and objects. The whole codebase lived in 1 file, used nearly 200 global variables, and to give you a sense of scale: I ran into trouble because GOTO couldn't jump more than 4096 lines of code. Solved that with double jumps 🤘

All talent no skill.

> **Note**: The GOTO statement lets you jump to pre-defined locations in the code. Once popular, the practice went away with the [Structured Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) movement of the 60's and 70's and was replaced in most contexts with functions by the early 90's. You might still see GOTO in performance-critical low-level applications.

The word "mess" doesn't even begin to describe my big project. I used global variables named `a`, `b`, .. `aa`, `ab` sort of like a programmer in the 1960's might use absolute memory addressing. I even re-used variables between features, which meant that a variable's exact meaning depended on how you got there.

This caused many hard to fix bugs. Click through the UI in a new sequence of steps and everything gets jumbled up.

## How shared state causes problems

The intermingled state made it so my code's exact behavior depended on how users (really just me) went through features. Here's a simplified example:

```pascal
var counter: integer

counter := 0

add:
	counter := counter + 1
	writeln(counter)

sub:
	counter := counter - 1
	writeln(counter)
	goto add

fun_feature1:
	counter := counter + 10
	goto sub

fun_feature2:
	counter := 2
	goto fun_feature1
```

- `add`: the `add` block adds +1 and prints the value
- `sub`: the `sub` block subs -1, prints the value, and jumps to `add`
- `fun_feature1`: the `fun_feature1` block adds +10 and jumps to `sub`
- `fun_feature2`: the `fun_feature2` block prints a message and jumps to `fun_feature1`

> **Note**: DOS was limited to 25 lines. Turbo Pascal used 4 lines for the UI. Meaning my code spanned _at least_ 195 screens. With all 200+ variables defined in a big block at the top of the file. 12 year old Swiz must've been a genius.

## Unclear shared state happens quickly

You don't need GOTO programming to run into unclear shared state. Here's a typical situation that happens in event-based code:

```javascript
let menuIsOpen = false;

function toggleMenu() {
  menuIsOpen = !menuIsOpen;
  window.localStorage.setItem("savedMenuState", menuIsOpen);

  updateMenu();
}

function updateMenu() {
  if (menuIsOpen) {
    // display menu
  } else {
    // hide menu
  }
}

document.onload = () => {
  menuIsOpen = window.localStorage.getItem("savedMenuState");
  updateMenu();
};
```

## Prefer pure functions

The issue is that neither `toggleMenu` nor `updateMenu` are [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). You can't tell what they'll do unless you know the value of `menuIsOpen`.

> **Note**: A pure function is one that relies only on its arguments and has no side-effects. You know it's pure when calling the same function multiple times with unchanged arguments produces the same result.

## When shared state works great

Shared state isn't all doom and gloom. It causes problems when you have asynchronous or threaded code and unclear access patterns.

But your database is a repository of shared state and that works great. The cache in your networking layer is a type of shared state. Works fine. State management libraries popular in modern app development are all about sharing state and they can be fantastic.

What gives?

Explicitly declared state dependencies with strict guidelines around access patterns make all the difference. If a compiler or linter can enforce those patterns, even better.

```javascript
function SomeBeautifulData({ id }) {
	const { data } = useQuery(
		['beautiful-data', id],
		...
	)

	return data.map( ... )
}
```

Thanks to explicit state dependencies, you can let framework machinery handle the details 😍

PS: databases achieve this with ACID – atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability. By ensuring every write completes before any read and that writes can't conflict, a database can ensure you always read the right data.
