## The interview

**![]()![Google London HQ](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK.jpg "Google London HQ")_![]()\*\*\*\*_**

- describe a cool recent project, go into the technical nitty gritty
- what's an exception and how does it work
- what is a memory leak and how would you go about debugging it
- automated testing! talk, go!
- write some code to create [powersets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset)
- how would you look for a file containing a keyword in a deeply-ish nested directory structure

I have no idea how well I answered the questions ... you know how these things are, you can explain at great detail what you _think_ something is and how it behaves. But you might well be completely wrong. The funniest part was after I explained a recent project ([time-series analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series "Time series") for predicting how much money I'll have in two weeks) and Andrew's response was something along the lines of _"Oh that's really cool! Do you have any plans on making it into a service? ... wait, I'm interviewing you for Google ..."_ He seemed a bit confused. Another interesting moment was when I was explaining [memory leaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak "Memory leak"). He was looking for an answer inside the [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 "Java (programming language)") or C++ world (even made sure I knew them beforehand) and instead I explained that a cool way of getting memory leaks with javascript is through closures that are left hanging. I did also give the answer he was looking for, but off-handedly. That somehow sent me into a long explanation of what closures are and how the concept is neatly related to continuations and function curling. And what _those_ are. He generally let me wander around with my answers, probably trying to poke into what I do know and what I don't, even if it's beyond the scope of specific questions.

## Coding under pressure

```python
def powerset(set):
      binaries = [bin(a) for a in range(2^len(set))]
      power = []
      for yeses in binaries:
        subset = []
	yeses = str(yeses)
	for i in range(len(yeses)):
                 if yeses[i] == “1”:
        		subset.append(set[i])
	power.append(subset)
      return power
```

## And now we wait

In general I think I managed to convince Andrew that even though my explanations often came with a _"I haven't looked into how this works **exactly, **but here's my understanding of what should be going on"_ I know a fair bit about technology and if push came to shove, I could code my way out of a wet paper bag to save a life. If he got the same impression, the next step is a full day of back-to-back technical interviews at Google's London offices. First though, we wait for "my" recruiter to get back to me about how the phone conversation went.
