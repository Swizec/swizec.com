Lately there has been raging debate in the blogosphere (is that still a word?) around whether [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS "RSS") is dead or not and the fact that it&#x27;s apparently been dying ever since it was first conceived in 1999 or thereabouts. Arguments range all the way from the fact that it is useless in light of [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter") and [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook"), that it never managed to jump the gap, that people simply can&#x27;t use it and that it all looks like RSS readers are being shut off left and right. Signs of great decay left and right, let&#x27;s abandon the poor thing completely and let it die in peace right? But there is one very very important thing that everybody is missing: RSS is not a user-facing technology. Just like the [semantic web](http://semanticweb.org "Semantic Web"), it was never meant to be something people actually _use_. RSS is essentially one big hack, a pretty good way of having content delivered to you without specifically going out there and looking for it. Even though, essentially, that&#x27;s exactly what your RSS reader does. It&#x27;s got a list of websites it checks every so often and then gets back to you with the results. In that regard it&#x27;s essentially a bunch of bookmarks, you&#x27;re just not tending to them yourself. It&#x27;s just a bit easier for a computer to read xml than a website. With pubsubhubbub the way this is done has changed a little, but no biggie. Ok, so RSS is a content distribution technology for computers. Now, we all know that as technologies go, there needs to be that one killer feature that trumps all alternatives right? Well twitter&#x27;s got one, the [communication protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") is dead simple, simpler than phones. Great! And facebook&#x27;s got one too, they&#x27;re a bit of everything, not very simple, but everyone&#x27;s got a facebook so you&#x27;re not leaving any time soon because you&#x27;re locked. Great! What does RSS have? Well, it&#x27;s got geeks. Lots and lots and lots of hardcore geeks. Did you know geeks produce the most content on [social networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network "Social network")? How do you think stuff gets on your twitter and your facebook? Somebody&#x27;s got to post it there before it can go viral. That someone likely found out via RSS. Sure this can be automated, but then you&#x27;ve just ruined the most important part of consuming content via twitter or facebook - the social filtering. But there&#x27;s an even more important feature to RSS. **Infinite scalability. Infinite distributability.** Both twitter and facebook are tied to a single provider. Twitter&#x27;s servers go down and all you see is a failwhale. No content for you. Imagine, for example, a huge earthquake hits california. Now suddenly both twitter&#x27;s and facebook&#x27;s [data centers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center "Data center") are offline. No content. But RSS would bravely go on working perfectly. Some sites might not be able to update, but the rest of the world wouldn&#x27;t even notice a glitch. Everything just works smoothly. Basically I guess what I&#x27;m saying is the same as [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/13/howToRebootRss.html). RSS is here to stay, [somebody](http://lazyreadr.com/) just needs to step up to the plate and make an RSS reader for _people._
