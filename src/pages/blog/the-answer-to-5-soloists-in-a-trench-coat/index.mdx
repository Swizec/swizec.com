[name|Friend], many of you wrote back this week saying that I left you hanging on a cliffhanger. _"Yes! This is my team! What do we do!?"_

Love striking a chord like this ‚ù§Ô∏è If you didn't read the email, it's pretty good üëâ [5 soloists in a trench coat](https://swizec.com/blog/5-soloists-in-a-trench-coat/).

The email was about a common team dysfunction where everyone works like a soloist and every point of collaboration feels like pulling teeth. It ended on a cliffhanger because it's the intro portion of a whole book section for [a new book I'm writing](https://swizec.com/blog/can-i-get-your-opinion/).

Thanks for confirming it's gonna work :)

The full solution will take a book to explain. Here's the tl;dr trick you can try right now:

## Force the team to work on 1 story at a time

They will grumble. Even complain. When my manager first made us do this 4 years ago I remember saying that it feels like there's little gerbils running around my mental model of the code constantly moving things around and how am I supposed to get anything done if I can't keep track of what's going on?

And you know what [name|]? I got used to it. Started liking it even. It's okay if people move your code. You'll find it. Do you _need_ to have everything memorized or can you just get better at navigating the code as it is right now?

I believe in you.

### Why 1 story at a time works

The biggest reason I fell in love with this style of work is that it solves the dysfunctions of soloists in a trench coat.

- pull requests become easy because you understand what people are working on
- no more PR begging because people need your code to work on theirs
- standups become useful because you ~~need~~ want to coordinate
- architectural discussion happens when work starts, not in PRs, because you need to coordinate
- things move faster because you're pulling together

Better yet, this approach follows straight out of [the theory of constraints](https://swizec.com/blog/build-better-software-with-the-theory-of-constraints/) and leads to [the best burndown charts I've ever seen](https://swizec.com/blog/how-we-made-the-best-burndown-chart-youve-ever-seen/). This is how we went from _"eh don't even worry about finishing sprint, that never happens"_ to sprints finishing on time as a norm.

We even finish early a lot of the time! Then we can go run around doing sidequests. It's great.

Cheers,<br/>
