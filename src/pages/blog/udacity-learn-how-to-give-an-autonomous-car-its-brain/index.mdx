A few days ago an email birdie delivered this amazing piece of news:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdCnb0EFAzk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdCnb0EFAzk)

In short, [Sebastian Thrun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun) of [ai-class.com](http://ai-class.com), [Stanford](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.43,-122.17&spn=0.01,0.01&q=37.43,-122.17 (Stanford%20University)&t=h>) and [Google-autonomous-cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car) fame is launching [a new class](http://www.udacity.com/) to teach everyone about creating cars that can drive themselves. Well, to create their brains ... but considering Mythbusters create an RC car every three weeks, the mechanics are probably a solved problem.

Having taken the artificial intelligence class last semester, there is no doubt in my mind _this class will be **awesome.**_ The combination of world-class professors and an online setting just works so much better than any other class I've been to ... hell I've said before that [I wish all my classes were online](https://swizec.com/blog/can-i-please-take-all-my-classes-online/) from now on.

And the cool thing about Udacity as a whole?

They're aiming to revolutionize [university education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education)! Starting off with autonomous cars and basic computer science this semester, it will eventually cover the whole computer science spectrum and even provide students with actual certified degrees. Like a "real" university.

I wonder how long it will take before I can ratify classes by Sebastian Thrun at my university, but the sooner the better because I expect to be spending much more time on his classes this semester than on most of my _real_ classes.

That said, I'm looking for classmates. Studying is more fun when you can share!

Did I mention [autonomous cars are super awesome](https://swizec.com/blog/science-wednesday-selfdriving-cars)?
