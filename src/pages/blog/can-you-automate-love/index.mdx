Friend, what's the laziest thing you've ever done?

The internet's best answer is this legendary officer [who ordered a ship to change course to get the morning sun out of his eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rgpdf/what_is_the_laziest_thing_youve_ever_done/cdnafqe/).

But we're engineers, our lazy looks like this üëá

You get tired of a task, start to automate, continue to automate, keep going, and wait what was the task again ...

After 24 years of coding I've got lots of those stories üòÖ

Like when I replaced a $6000/year editor [with a $2/year gaggle of JavaScript](https://swizec.com/blog/how-a-dollar12-aws-bill-powers-a-dollar50k-business#newsletter-layouting). Great use of serverless.

Or when I was broke and [built a bot that emailed me from the future](https://swizec.com/blog/a-message-from-your-future-self-2). _"hey Swiz, if you keep going like this you'll be broke_

That was fun. Designed my own machine learning financial projection algorithm and everything!

The Google interviewer said: _"Don't mention interest in machine learning on your resume if you have no experience"_. üòÇ

Rude.

Or that time I used [AWS Lambda and Twilio to answer the door](https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-answer-the-door-with-aws-lambda-and-twilio). Callbox calls a Twilio phone number, Twilio pings a Lambda, Lambda sends you a text, answer the text, door opens.

No more phone calls from packages!

Then I realized you can add the gate code to your address and delivery people let themselves in. Even easier üòÇ

But it was fun to build.

Been meaning to automate feeding treats to Kiwi ü¶ú and got stuck on _"Oh right, I don't know robotics ..."_. Wouldn't that be cool though? Build a robot arm that listens to audio cues and feeds your bird treats so he goes back to his cage instead of destroying the cabinets.

But I digress.

Here is _the_ coolest most laziest almost-finished automation I've ever attempted üëá

## Automating love with serverless

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvvPLlP4518](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvvPLlP4518)

For Valentine's Day this year, I got a Lovebox for The Girl. A cute little IoT device that spins a 3D printed heart and shows photos from an app.

She loved it.

And she loved it even more when I said _"I'm gonna build a bot to make sure you get a new photo of our relationship every day"_

![](giphy:omg_love)

Lovebox has no API and I spent the first 3 hours of this project [reverse engineering their GraphQL API](https://swizec.com/blog/reverse-engineer-a-graphql-api-to-automate-love-notes-codewithswiz-24). Learned a lot!

Like did you know encrypted https traffic is _easily_ snooped on when you have physical access to the client? ü§Ø

Finding this GraphQL mutation was the hard part:

```graphql
mutation sendPixNote(
  $base64: String
  $recipient: String
  $date: Date
  $options: JSON
  $contentType: [String]
) {
  sendPixNote(
    base64: $base64
    recipient: $recipient
    date: $date
    options: $options
    contentType: $contentType
  ) {
    _id
    type
    recipient
    url
    date
    status {
      label
      __typename
    }
    base64
    __typename
  }
}
```

The rest was easy:

1.  Install `graphql-request`, a smol graphql client
2.  Init with a snooped JWT token
3.  `await client.request(mutation)`
4.  sls invoke -f sendNote

And a Serverless AWS Lambda wakes up on your machine as if it was running in production. 30 seconds later, the Lovebox spins üòç

Next step: S3 bucket with a pool of photos and a daily trigger.

What do you think, will this work? hit reply

PS: I'm doing a [live serverless Q&A on Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-mEf4K9as), you should join :)

PPS: look what arrived in the mail! more on this next week
