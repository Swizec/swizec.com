Last night [I watched a documentary about Senna](http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-10-8/swizec/2124 "I learned two things today 10.8.") and if you are into [motor sports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport "Motorsport") at all, or just like watching movies about inspirational people, you should totally watch it. If you can't swing the time, at least go have a look at last year's [Top Gear Senna tribute](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=top+gear+senna&page=&utm_source=opensearch). There is a quote from the movie that really stands out for me:

> By being a [racing driver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing "Auto racing") you are under risk all the time. By being a racing driver means you are racing with other people. **And if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver** because we are competing, competing to win. And the main motivation to all of us is to compete for victory, it's not to come 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th. I race to win as long as I feel it's possible. Sometimes you get it wrong? Sure, it's impossible to get it right all the time. But I race designed to win, as long as I feel I'm doing it right.

I believe Senna said this to explain why he crashed out [Alain Prost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost "Alain Prost") in the first corner of some championship deciding race (I forget which). An event that was possibly the saddest way to become a world championship ever, but nevertheless. But the circumstances don't really matter. The important bit is that _if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver._

> Villeneuve (or any of the other greats for that matter...Prost, Hill, [Mansell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell "Nigel Mansell"), etc) were spectacular a number of times. Senna was spectacular every single time.

Do you want to be spectacular a number of times or _every_ time?
