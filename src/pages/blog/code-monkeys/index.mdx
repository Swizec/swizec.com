So it&#x27;s been decided, I am henceforth to write my thoughts or whatever into this blog on a bidaily schedule, that is every two days rather than twice a day. We can only speculate as to how long I&#x27;ll actually be able to uphold this decision, but hopefully it&#x27;ll be for a long long time.

A few days ago my boss asked me if I know of anyone that needs a web development job since we&#x27;re getting a lot of projects thrown at us and I won&#x27;t be able to finish them all in time. And I said I&#x27;d have to look into it, at this point excitement was fairly low.

Then the next day my other boss said that if I don&#x27;t find anyone my predecessor could always be rehired for a few projects, but that they&#x27;d prefer hiring an assistant or two for me. This is where the excitement begun. Why this is significant exactly? Well it means I&#x27;d get to tell people what to do rather than be merely their equal.

As it turns out I did find somebody who needs work and will be interviewing them come Tuesday. Now of course I won&#x27;t be interviewing them alone (hello, my first giving an interview, I can&#x27;t pull something like that off on my own), but I will be the most significant part in the decision making process if I understand everything correctly.

If all goes how I think it might I&#x27;ll be somebody&#x27;s very-low-level boss. Awesome.
