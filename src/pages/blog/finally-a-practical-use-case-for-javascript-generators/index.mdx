JavaScript generators are amazing. A brilliant concept infinitely useful on paper.

They let you write infinite loops that terminate. Yield values from functions before they finish. Build lazy data structures. Lazy evaluation programming!

A functional programmer's wet dream. üòç

And I bet you've never used a JavaScript generator even once did you? Do you even know the syntax?

I bet you don't.

Turns out generators aren't very useful in practice. üò¢

But yesterday, after years of knowing about generators, years of itching to use them, years of ... I FOUND A USE! A real world practical use-case where generators _actually_ make your code better. üò±

We were adding automatic linking of twitter usernames to my [TechLetterApp](https://techletter.app) project. Find a piece of text, parse out `@username` instances, turn into links.

Easy right?

I thought so too. Complications around inserting complex nodes into an abstract syntax tree (AST) aside, parsing those usernames is hard to do elegantly.

Unless you use generators üòõ

<ContentUpgrades.Javascript />

## Here's how we did it üëá

First, you create a regex that matches `@` followed by a series of word symbols.

```javascript
const UserRegex = new RegExp(/@(\w+)/, "g")
```

Then you create a generator that runs this regex in a loop. Each `UserRegex.exec()` returns the next match.

```javscript
function* getUsernames(string) {
        let match = null;

        do {
            match = UserRegex.exec(string);
            if (match) {
                yield match;
            }
        } while (match);
    }
```

We have a `*getUsernames` generator that takes a `string`. The asterisk notation changes a function to a generator.

Inside, a loop runs as long as `match` has a value. Assigned on each iteration as a `UserRegex.exec` call.

We `yield` existing values on every loop iteration. Last one will be `null` and we don't want to return those.

Yield is how you return values from generators. Notice that even after returning a value, the generator keeps running. That's the generator magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You can now find all usernames in a string with a loop.

```javascript
const string = "this is a test with @swizec and @kyleshevlin, maybe @lukeed05"

for (const username of getUsernames(string)) {
  console.log(username)
}
```

That outputs

    ["@swizec", "swizec"]
    ["@kyleshevlin", "kyleshevlin"]
    ["@lukeed05", "lukeed05"]
