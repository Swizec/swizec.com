Wet, late and hungry I arrived at the IJS venue where I&#x27;ll be staying all day listening to odd people talking about interesting stuff - very interesting I hope. Just so you know, I have a valid excuse for being late and missing the event&#x27;s introduction and everything, but let&#x27;s not get into that now (just so you know, I didn&#x27;t oversleep). Right now I&#x27;m listening to Dusan Omercevic, I believe, talking about openID.

Coding a regular login system is easy as hell, this just seems needlessly complex for probably around 90% web devs out there. **11:28** Very interesting invitation to try along this guy&#x27;s hacking techniques on our websites. Should be useful to test Chlorine Boards. Hope I don&#x27;t do too much damage, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t have anywhere else to test than production websites. **12:12** Wow I think I need a new pair of trousers &#x27;cause I just shat brix! The methods for doing crazy fun things on other people&#x27;s websites that Ga
