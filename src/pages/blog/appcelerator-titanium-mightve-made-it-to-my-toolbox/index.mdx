## Titanium good

1.  It's [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), if you haven't noticed I _love_ javascript
2.  The same app works both on android and [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios "IOS")
3.  Titanium API's are generally simpler than what I've seen of native iOS
4.  Properly using the [user interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") API's gives you a native look&feel

## Titanium bad

1.  The [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment"); I don't like being forced to use an IDE and I very much hate being forced to use a _crappy_ IDE.
2.  Everything looks like it would be pretty much impossible to develop with my usual [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") method
3.  Code once, run everywhere is good in principle, but it usually ends up lacking the polish of a real native app, especially since android and iOS have slightly different [UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") guidelines and traditions

## Conclusion

All in all, there's a lot of potential in this Titanium stuff despite the shortcomings. I might just start adding a mobile part to my future projects ... there's certainly some that could use it.
