ðŸ‘‹ today we're trying something new â€“Â suggesting newsletters you might like. It's a collab approach that helps us grow.

Please do check them out :)

## Game Dev JS Weekly

One of the first things that got me excited about React way back in 2014/15 is that its rendering engine works a lot like a game engine. Having built a few old school DOS games, the benefit clicked immediately ðŸ¤©

You see in old school games your code becomes _littered_ with geometry math, physics, and moving things around. Half your time goes into "add 2px here, 3px there" and the other half goes into jumping around that code when you want to work on the game logic itself.

React changed that into a declarative approach â€“Â I want a square and it moves over there. Then you hit re-render and React figures out the DOM diffing for you. Fantastic!

I even built a [space invaders clone](https://github.com/Swizec/space-invaders) and presented that as a neat demo pushing the limits at HTML5DevConf in SF.

That approach didn't pan out long term. Nobody uses React to build games these days.

Which is why you should sign up for [Game Dev JS Weekly](https://gamedevjsweekly.com/?utm_source=swizec), a weekly free newsletter all about HTML5 Game Development. Sent every Friday, managed by Andrzej Mazur from Enclave Games, creator of the js13kGames competition.

## Wonder Tools

Another of my interests that I used to talk about a lot is productivity hacking. The phrase has fallen on hard times of late, but don't believe what disgruntled folk tell you about productivity hacking.

It's not about packing more into your day, it's about removing friction. Those little annoyances that aren't quite worth fixing but grind on your psyche every day.

For example: I like to look good on camera. Even if it's a zoom call. The biggest improvement comes from good lighting.

I used to light my face with big bulky studio lights that were _fine but annoying_. Two lights, separate physical switches, can't reach from sitting position, need to stand up a little to turn them on.

It's a small thing, I know, but juuuuust enough friction that I'd use only one light and keep it on all day. Easier that way. Then I'd wonder "why do my eyes hurt?"

A few weeks ago I upgraded to Elgato lights you can turn on an customize with a Stream Deck sitting on your desk. Change color, intensity, etc when you need to ðŸ¤© And I moved a big bulky audio thing off my desk to make the space more pleasant.

And oh my god _it is so nice_. Feels like getting rid of an itch that's been bugging you for years.
