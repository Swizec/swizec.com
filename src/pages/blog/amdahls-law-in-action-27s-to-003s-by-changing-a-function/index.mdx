Perhaps the most important lesson I've learned while studying computer science is that of [Amdahl's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law).

Amdahl's law is generally used to predict the maximum speedup by improving a single component of a system (say, a function or a database). But the implications are simple: _Improve the thing that will **actually** help._

As programmers, however, we would rather contemplate just what is [the fastest way to concatenate a string](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/the-sad-tragedy-of-micro-optimization-theater.html). Or whether [PHP](http://www.php.net) is much faster than Ruby. And just how much more traffic you can handle with 5 or 10 fcgi workers. And so on. The internet is riddled with these questions. And let's not forget the age old debate of speed improvements by using raw [SQL](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45498) instead of an [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

Once upon a time I even wrote a web framework where I made sure to _always use the fastest pattern of doing X in PHP_. I knew databases were slow, so I did a lot of the work regarding JOINs and such in PHP.

Yeah.

## Optimizing where it matters

The other day I finally assembled all the bits and pieces for an [evolutionary algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) in [Haskell](http://haskell.org).

I'm trying to print _[Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program)_ by performing random changes on a population of strings - eventually I want to create an extensible framework for evolutionary algorithms that will let me [write poetry programmatically](http://swizec.github.com/Le-Thesis/).

It took **27 seconds** to go 5 epochs. Just five generations.

```log
  INIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
  MUT     time   26.47s  ( 27.00s elapsed)
  GC      time    0.62s  (  0.62s elapsed)
  EXIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
  Total   time   27.08s  ( 27.62s elapsed)

  %GC     time       2.3%  (2.2% elapsed)

  Productivity  97.7% of total user, 95.8% of total elapsed
```

Okay, it's definitely not a problem with memory access. 97.7% of the time is spent in computation, this is good, but slightly worrying. Let's do some profiling!

```log
COST CENTRE   MODULE           %time %alloc

levenshtein   Evaluators.Basic  91.5  100.0
levenshtein.d Evaluators.Basic   8.5    0.0
```

The [levenshtein distance function I implemented](https://swizec.com/blog/levenshtein-distance-in-haskell/) costs 100% of [computation time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)!

After replacing my function with [the implementation suggested by Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/w4gs6/levenshtein_distance_in_haskell/c5a6jjz) life instantly became much easier. It now takes just 0.03 seconds to compute 5 epochs of the algorithm.

**27 seconds -> 0.03 seconds by changing a single function.**

The problem I have now is anything larger than ~25 epochs makes my computer decide something funny is going and kill the program, which says I'm doing something terrible with memory.

Then again, there _are_ 480195 population members at the 25th epoch ... I probably don't need that many.

By the way, it's still not a memory problem per se (for 20 epochs):

```log
  Total   time   10.72s  ( 10.80s elapsed)

  %GC     time      23.4%  (23.3% elapsed)

  Alloc rate    2,736,341,212 bytes per MUT second

  Productivity  76.6% of total user, 76.0% of total elapsed
