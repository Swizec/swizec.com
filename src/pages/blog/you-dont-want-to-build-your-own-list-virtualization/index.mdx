Chatroom is slow? I know, I&#x27;ll just use list virtualization!Well now you have two problems.https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/958840988495093760List virtualization is hard, dear reader. _So_ hard. “Pfft, I can build that in an hour,” I thought until I tried.



It&#x27;s been 3 days. Last night, I dreamed scrollbars and mouse wheel events.



## Hold up, what&#x27;s list virtualization?



[List virtualization](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+virtualization&amp;oq=list+virtualization&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2398j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) is a performance improvement technique for large lists or tables. Whenever your UI becomes slow because you&#x27;re rendering too much stuff, you can use list virtualization to make it fast again.



We&#x27;ve been hit with this problem recently at [Yup](https://www.yup.com). When our sessions get long, like hundreds of messages between tutor and student, tutors start complaining about the UI feeling sluggish.



They can&#x27;t type, they can&#x27;t talk, it&#x27;s like teaching through a paper bag. Terrible.



We don&#x27;t know why it became such a big problem right now, but 600 milliseconds to add a message to a chatroom is just too much. Needs to be fixed.



That&#x27;s where list virtualization comes in.



Instead of keeping the whole hundreds-of-messages chatroom rendered, you render just 30 messages. Or 40, or 10. Whatever the number, you render a small subset of the messages.



And that gives you a performance boost. Fewer DOM nodes to deal with, faster rendering times. Especially on slow computers.



The problem may have become a problem because of the [Spectre and Meltdown fixes that hit Intel processors with up to 30% slowdowns](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/a-major-kernel-vulnerability-is-going-to-slow-down-all-intel-processors-2/). When you&#x27;re already using a slow $300 computer… yeah.



## How to virtualize a list, in theory



So, how do you virtualize a list?

Virtualizing a list is simple in theory. You maintain a window and move it around your list.



A `windowSize` variable tells you how many nodes you&#x27;re rendering, and a `windowIndex` variable tells you where to start rendering. Then you `.splice` your data array and render away.

I was doing it in [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), so it seemed super tricky. We had complex logic in place to append and remove and prepend messages to the list as necessary.



Think things like



1. Find previous message with `$("nth-child")`
2. Manipulate with `$(ul).append`
3. Find the correct scroll position



Messy.



After a few hours of that approach, I gave up.



> Screw DOM manipulation, it&#x27;s 2018 and the DOM is fast. Re-render it.



To my surprise, throwing away the list and re-rendering for every message insertion or scroll event works friggin’ great. Like really seriously great. Even in Backbone where you get none of React&#x27;s diffing magic.



I didn&#x27;t run proper benchmarks, but on my 2017 MBP at home, re-rendering a 30-element list happens in 10 to 15 milliseconds.



1. `$("ul").html("")`
2. `elements.splice(windowIndex, windowSize)`
3. loop and append



That re-renders in just 10 milliseconds on my 15&quot; MBP, 30 milliseconds on my 13&quot; MBP. Both running RoR and sidekiq and webpack and the rest in the background.



13&quot; is so much slower because it&#x27;s just dual core. I&#x27;ll run a proper benchmark for this soon because I&#x27;m curious.



My point is that re-rendering is fast and easy. You can totally get away with re-rendering on every mousewheel event if your `windowSize` is small enough.



I now had a virtualized list. Worked great.

Except the UX is confusing. You get to the edge of the scrollbar and it just keeps going and going. Wat?



## Where things get tricky



This strange scrolling UX is where things go belly up and life gets hard. Users don&#x27;t expect to hit the edge of the scrollbar before the edge of the content, you see.



So I tried a couple things and haven&#x27;t really figured this out. I think I&#x27;m on the right path, but I&#x27;m also starting to lose my mind.



Watch this gif. Scrolling up works great, but then you start scrolling down and everything goes topsy turvy.



https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/958840988495093760



The version in this gif tries to compensate for a few things.



1. Uses an offset from the edge to start adding messages before you hit the edge
2. Adjusts this offset to your scrolling speed
3. Adjusts `windowIndex` delta to your scrolling speed



Adding messages is basically just moving the `windowIndex`. That part is easy.



But the mousewheel is a tricky beast. On my mouse, the smallest `deltaY` is 4 pixels. That&#x27;s okay.



The biggest `deltaY` I&#x27;ve seen is around 3000 pixels. In a single event call.

So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been dealing with. I wish I could just use [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized), but I can&#x27;t because _&quot;We&#x27;ll have time to rewrite later&quot;_. Can&#x27;t come soon enough 😅



## Update: OMG I DID IT



It&#x27;s not as smooth as Slack, but it&#x27;s good enough for now.



https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/959151765185691650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw





Wasn&#x27;t that complicated after all. Just a bunch of maths with magic numbers.
