## An internet

Then I got an internet. I was still reading books. Mostly when school forced it upon me. Then I would devour a piece of classical literature in two afternoons. Because, you know, everything is easier at the last minute. And I would _enjoy_ the book. Absolutely love it! After the deadline ... back to the internet. This has gotten progressively worse to the point I simply don't allow myself near a bookstore anymore. What's the point in buying books if you never find the time to read them?
