Early speakers look great. We'll have folks talking about tech debt, about how your job is _not_ to know everything, and applying AI to teamwork because of course.

You have [until July 21 to submit a talk](https://gitnation.com/events/techlead-conference-2025/cfp).

My talk will be about lessons learned when your team/org grows hella fast. It's a chance for me to unscramble the brain and figure out wtf happened. I wrote once that _product-market-fit feels like you're getting dragged kicking and screaming by the market as you desperately try to hold on_. Yep.

Plasmidsaurus went from ~6 engineers to ~15 since I joined in August. Whole company went from 40-ish to 100-ish. Growing even more by September ðŸ¤ž

So that's what I'll be talking about. There's gotta be good lessons in there right?

Come see at [TechLeadConf 2025](https://gitnation.com/badges/techlead-conference-2025/swizec_teller)

Got questions I should answer in my talk? Hit reply.

Cheers,<br/>
