[![by h.koppdelaney](./img/3252-3068888802_7ce4f8f4b9.jpg "by h.koppdelaney")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/h-k-d/3068888802/sizes/m/in/photostream/) Just over a year ago, after flaming out of a startup, I decided to stay in school. _[Doing a startup taught me the value of staying in school](http://swizec.com/blog/doing-a-startup-taught-me-the-value-of-staying-in-school/swizec/1819)._ On Monday, just 6 days from now, I will officially become a dropout. I haven't graduated. I didn't enroll in any classes this autumn. I will finish my [undergrad thesis](http://swizec.github.com/Le-Thesis/) research. One day I might even graduate. I missed graduating this year by a mouse hair. Didn't pass two mandatory classes from second year, while grabbing up ~115% credits for third year. Odd situation, I know. Regardless, doing all that extra work on the things I found useful was for naught. The school administration is too rigid to let me use those credits on the classes I failed. Passing those two classes would also mean a full semester commitment on them. I can't just sit the exams again and, right now, I am not willing to do that. It's been enough.

## Enough.
