Just over a year ago, after flaming out of a startup, I discovered the value of staying in school. At that time, I shared my experience in a piece titled _[Doing a startup taught me the value of staying in school](https://swizec.com/blog/doing-a-startup-taught-me-the-value-of-staying-in-school/)_.

On Monday, just six days from now, I will officially become a dropout.

I haven't graduated. I didn't enroll in any classes this fall. I continue to work on my [undergrad thesis](http://swizec.github.com/Le-Thesis/) research. One day, I might even graduate.

I came close to graduating this year, but I failed two mandatory classes from my second year, while I managed to earn approximately ~115% of credits for my third year—a strange situation, indeed. And despite all my efforts in the things I found meaningful, it all came to naught as the school administration was too rigid to transfer those credits to the classes I failed.

Exams are, for the most part, nothing more than puzzles—puzzles that carry no consequence, practical or impractical. Unlike problematic job interviews, at least they care about your thought process. In school, however, the emphasis is on providing the exact answer the teaching assistants expect, following a predetermined methodology.

I learned plenty in spite of my studies.

I much prefer to _understand_ things, but my college experience did not seem optimized for comprehension. When I craved depth, I found my courses lacking. When I wished to understand, I found that the tight schedules were not forgiving. When I wanted to go beyond the confines of the curriculum and learn, I was told to do exactly what was asked.

I began to feel myself withdrawing from life. This blog, which previously saw month-over-month hockey stick growth, suddenly saw its traffic decline at the advent of my academic crunch time.

Despite receiving an influx of requests for freelancing work, I had to turn down several opportunities per week—I simply couldn't afford the time. 

On top of this, I missed out on numerous potential projects due to my academic commitments. I had to cease work on successful projects such as HipsterVision and Postme.me, as I didn't have the time to juggle them with my coursework.

So I lingered, and I stagnated.

Today, my business registration finally came through.

The future is looking brighter.
