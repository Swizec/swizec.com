~~sometimes~~ all the time you find code that makes you go O.o Someone did the weirdest thing, but it works. Probably.

My favorite thing to say in these moments is _"But why?"_. When it's really weird and we're good friends, I post this gif.

You have to be careful with that. It works when trust is super duper extra high and even then you have to be ready to back it up with a good conversation.

Here's a few better ways to ask that question.

- What problem does this solve for you?
- What do you like about this solution?
- Have you tried &lt;obvious approach>?
- I wasn't around for this, can you explain why &lt;obvious approach> wouldn't work here?
- Have you seen &lt;library that solves this problem>?
- I saw this solved a different way in &lt;other part of codebase>. Would that work here?
- In past projects I've done &lt;easier approach>. What do you think of that solution? Would it work here?

Asking "but why" makes people feel judged and puts them on the defensive. Personally I _love_ explaining but why and will talk your ear off. But normal people have a much smaller ego and will shut down when confronted directly.

Instead you approach with obvious curiosity, validate that this is in fact a brilliant solution you would never think of, and ask about all the constraints they were solving for that you didn't know about.

60% chance they tried the obvious solution and it didn't work. That's why the code looks weird. It has to!

Then you ask them to put that answer in a comment.

PS: the last 2 will probably result in a _"Oh thanks! I'll do that next time"_. Let it go, next time is fine
