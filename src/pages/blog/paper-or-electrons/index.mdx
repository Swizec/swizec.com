Was really looking forward to making today&#x27;s blog a review of [SteamPunk Magazine](http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/), but it so happened that I haven&#x27;t really managed to read it yet so all I can say about it thusfar is that it&#x27;s a rather nicely built item with some very solid reading and interesting things. It&#x27;s so interesting as to get stolen by a classmate ... If you&#x27;re looking into reading this, you should go paper because electrons just don&#x27;t do it justice.
