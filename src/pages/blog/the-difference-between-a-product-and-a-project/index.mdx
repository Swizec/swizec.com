A project is something you do, a product is something you own.

**Project** has a start and a finish. If you're lucky, a goal. You get or gather requirements, build the thing, ship, and move on. Done. You measure success by delivering on time and on budget.

**Product** has no start or finish. You support a business process, workflow, or a type of user. You look for friction in the system and find ways to improve. [You are never done](https://swizec.com/blog/writing-software-is-like-kicking-a-can/). Success looks like happy users, increased revenue, smoother workflows.

This is the key difference between [widget factory and empowered teams](https://swizec.com/blog/get-us-over-the-water-not-build-us-a-bridge/). The widget factory works on projects, the empowered team owns products.

Projects can help you organize product work – what's the next iteration, how do we get there, what fires need fixing – but you can't [own business outcomes](https://swizec.com/blog/own-the-outcome-not-the-work/), if all you ever do are projects. Then you're just a pair of hands. Someone else owns the product.

And remember: **[you can't side-quest a product](https://swizec.com/blog/you-cant-side-quest-a-product/)**. Many purely engineering initiatives like internal libraries are platform-type products in disguise.

You can use that to build a great promo packet, but don't try to solo own a product long-term with no support. You need time and resources to iterate.
