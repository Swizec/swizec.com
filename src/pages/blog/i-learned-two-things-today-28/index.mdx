![Social Media Outposts](./img/2534-4187565894_1e319e7ce0_m.jpg "Social Media Outposts")

Today I learned that being typecast as the Social Media Guy can put you in some pretty interesting spots. Doublerecall seems to have decided that when a launch page is made for something we're thinking about Swizec is the guy who will figure out how to get enough traffic to run a valid experiment. Thing is ... I don't know the first thing about doing that. Sure, I sometimes get lucky and get 6k visitors to some random things I say about the [pomodoro technique](https://swizec.com/blog/living-life-in-25min-increments/ "Living life in 25min increments") and stuff like that.

The real difficulty is in doing this consistently, figuring out what works, what doesn't and being able to produce thousands of traffic to a random webpage with at least a hint of regularity and reliability.

I learned that maybe e-marketers might be useful people too.

Today I also learned that despite how many times I spill my glass of water after putting it on the floor next to my bed when I decide to work on the bed I will never learn to stop doing that. It's just so convenient and the ratio of spilling the drink versus the times I don't just isn't enough to trip up my learning process apparently ... that is to say, the force of being lazy is just stronger.
