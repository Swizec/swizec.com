1.  Computers are everywhere
2.  Automation is pushing out middle-tier jobs

The basic idea is really simple - in the not very distant future programming will and should be as important as basic literacy is today. Not just basic computer literacy, but programming in the sense of combining and extending apps in novel ways to fit your problem area. There are a lot of professions for which automation is almost impossible to imagine - an artist, a firefighter, a winemaker, brewer, baker; the list goes on and on. In fact this was the top voted rebuttal of the whole story. A lot of professions need so much human touch it is inconceivable they would ever need programming.

## Someone else can do the coding

## What you can do?

Because changing how high school works is hard, I have a suggestion for something you can do **right now**! Only needs three steps too

1.  Find a nonprogrammer friend
2.  Take them out for a beer
3.  Teach them about programming

Give them the bug of automation. Do it with passion. Do it well. When they start looking at the world in terms of _Hmm ... I wonder how this could be made better, easier, more interesting. \_They will start coming back with real problems. Problems out of their solution scope, but something \_you_ can work on. And hey, startup opportunity! You now have somebody with a real problem looking for a real solution! Hooray.
