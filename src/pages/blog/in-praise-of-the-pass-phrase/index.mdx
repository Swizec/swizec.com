## Passwords suck

To make matters worse, "secure" passwords aren't secure at all. An 8 character password considering common [alphanumeric characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric "Alphanumeric") people use most often gives you 60^8 combinations. At 1000 guesses per second this is guessable in about 5000 years. Okay, that's impractical. You're better off using a different vector of attack ... like a good wrench to the wrist. Or those stupid security questions. But passwords aren't random sequences of letters! Remember, people can't memorise those. Most often they use a common word and capitalize the first letter, then add a few numbers at the end. Or possibly some numbers at the start. There are just 15,222 6 letter words in the English language, giving enough room to add two numbers. Accounting for capitalizing the first letter that gives us 25^2+15222+10^2 combinations. Guessable in about 15 seconds. Oops. Including common substitions - [1337 sp34k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet "Leet") - gives us a few more combinations and the usual password is guessable in about three days. And that's with a very secure looking password that is almost impossible to remember! Sure, we cheated a bit by using a [dictionary attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack "Dictionary attack"), but hey, anything goes! I'm sure real attackers have even more tricks up their sleeves.

## Pass phrases win
