You know how [last month](https://swizec.com/blog/16661-october-sidehustle-report/swizec/7883) was huge and money rained from the sky? November, not so much.



Didn&#x27;t even break even.



That&#x27;s one of the main surprises for my friends about running a business. They see a report like last month&#x27;s and their eyes go wide and they whisper amongst each other and crack jokes about how much money I have. They ignore the other reports.



What they forget is that a spike is not a trend. It can indicate a trend, but it rarely means you&#x27;re going to be making that much or more from now until eternity.

November was bad. Sure, there was a lot going on, attempts were made, but ultimately not much happened. Running a sale like my 30-at-30 promotion is like frontloading your customers.



You get an infusion of money now and it&#x27;s great, but those people from your audience aren&#x27;t going to be ready to buy anything else for a while. So instead of a trickle of sales every week for the next few months, you compact all those future sales into _now_.



That&#x27;s kinda what happened. Going to take a while for regular sales to rebound. Gonna need to develop some new products too.



Like that Intro to React and Redux video course I promised. Working on it :)



You may also have noticed that I haven&#x27;t been publishing as much in November. That&#x27;s because I was working on a lot of things that are going to show up in December&#x27;s report.



Some stuff I can&#x27;t talk about yet, other stuff you&#x27;ve likely already seen. Like the [JS Bundle](https://bestjavascript.io) we put out with a bunch of other authors.



If you haven&#x27;t seen that, then our marketing sucks.



Actuallyâ€¦ I&#x27;m gonna have some thoughts on that soonish ðŸ¤” Because it did not go as well as I&#x27;d hoped ðŸ˜…



Anyway, here&#x27;s November in numbers ðŸ‘‡



**Total revenue** $2249



**Gumroad sales** $1309 - [React D3v4](https://swizec.com/reactd3js): $1272 - [JS cheatsheet - es2017](https://es2017.io): $37



**Leanpub sales** $392 - React D3v4: $348 - React D3 old versions: $25 - [Why Programmers work at Night](http://nightowlsbook.com)



**Patreon pledges** $211



**Educative** $274 - React D3v4 course: $274



**Time investment:** 78 hours



**Expenses â†’**



- Editor: $500
- VA: $400
- Facebook ads: $985
- Twitter ads: $600
- Reddit ads: $36
- Drip: $149
- SumoMe: $99
- Webfaction: $10
- LiveEdu Pro: $10
- AWS: $14
- now.sh: $15
- bestjavascript.io domain: $46
- domainsquatting for ES6 domains: $149
- SmartBribe: $35
- mailchimp: $20
- MicroConf April ticket: $918
- DJI Spark: $649



**Effective hourly rate:** -$44/hour ðŸ˜‚



Okay okay, the accounting for this month is weird. The DJI Spark will serve me for months if not years. Real accountants look at things like that using something called [amortization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization).



You say _&quot;Okay, this cost $649 and has an effective lifespan of 24 months. Therefore, it costs $27/month&quot;_. But I&#x27;m lazy so I make that calculation in my head to decide if buying something is worth it, then put it in my reports as a one-time cost.



It all evens out in the end. As long as the average trend across months is up ðŸ“ˆ I&#x27;m okay.



PS: The hella expensive ads were for the JS Bundle, the revenue of which comes next month.
