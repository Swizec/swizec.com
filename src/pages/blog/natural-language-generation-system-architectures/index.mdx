This post is summarized from Chapter 3 of [Ruli Manurung](http://staf.cs.ui.ac.id/~maruli/)'s _[An evolutionary algorithm approach to poetry generation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inf.ed.ac.uk%2Fpublications%2Fthesis%2Fonline%2FIP040022.pdf)_ from 2003 - it is essentially 10 years old research from a fast moving field of science. However, these are core principles and techniques; a casual perusal of wikipedia indicates they are still valid. If you know of something new and spectacular, I'd love to know.

## [Natural Language Generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation "Natural language generation")

1.  [Content determination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_determination "Content determination") - what you're going to say, based on knowledge, communicative goal and user's expectations
2.  Sentence planning - how are you going to say it. Remember, semantically sane!
3.  Surface realisation - the final output, which specific words to use, do sentences follow each other nicely and so on. You could call this _style \_or \_flow_.

## Traditional architecture

## NLG as a search problem

One way to approach natural language generation in an integrated manner is by posing it as a search problem - you have a search space of possible solutions, your job is merely to find the best.

- ![A search space](http://graphvisualizer.org/images/examples/nc_gilbert.png "A search space") This can be done in many ways:

  - **hillclimbing** - take a random spot on the map. With each step, consider all possible moves and move in the best direction. Hope you don't get trapped in a local maximum
  - **systemic search**- go through all possible solutions and find the best one. Problem with this approach is that it can take a while to finish, but you always get the most optimal solutionFour main ways exist to implement this: chart generation (use charts to define the search space and go from there), [truth maintenance systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_maintenance "Reason maintenance") (have assumptions, make sure they stay true), "redefining the search problem" (a lot of invalid choices can be pruned out based on linguistic knowledge, which helps with the explosive search space size), constraint logic programming (everyone who's done a prolog course has seen this I think)
  - **stochastic search** - this is my favorite approach since it involves a bunch of interesting algorithms. The basic idea is that you can define a set of constraints and then "guess" solutions based on those constraints. But since each constraint is probabilistic, you have a lot of flexibility in coming up with solutions.

  ## Overgeneration and ranking

  This approach is based on the model of an _author_ and a _reviewer_. The author continuously outputs a bunch of plausible solutions that the reviewer then ranks on viability and finally picks one to present to the user. [![Author-reviewer model](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/author-reviewer-model.png "Author-reviewer model")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/author-reviewer-model.png) The beauty of this approach lies in the fact that each part of the system only has to concern itself with what it does best, while they still collaborate so you aren't trapped in a pipeline architecture.

  ## Opportunistic planning

  ## Poetry?

  Poetry suffers from a lot of the problems other NLG systems have already had to tackle - a unity of content and form, lack of clearly defined goals etc. Therefore the best approach we can take is some combination of opportunistic planning, which gives us the ability to have lightbulb moments while writing poetry, and stochastic search, which gives us the needed flexibility in the face of many constraints without any goals.
