We often write code to distract ourselves from the fact we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re building.Yesterday I had a long conversation with a friend who&#x27;s starting a company. Let&#x27;s call him Matt because that&#x27;s not his name.After months of thought, Matt quit his job and went looking for investors. He realized it was too early and he doesn&#x27;t know shit. So he started really digging into his idea and his market.He uncovered a goldmine.A swathe of the economy that&#x27;s growing, inefficient, and needs some help. His wonderful idea will grease the wheels, the economy will flourish, the consumers will love him, and he&#x27;ll get filthy rich in the process ðŸ’ªMatt wanted my help hiring an engineer. Or a designer. Someone, anyone, who could help him build the product.Matt is not technical, you see. His skill lies in business development, sales, and big picture thinking. The skills you _really_ need to succeed in the market he&#x27;s targeting. The stuff us engineers run away from screaming.



_&quot;How do I find an engineer? Someone local, someone I can sit down and work with, who won&#x27;t rip me off.&quot;_



ðŸ¤”



He&#x27;s unfunded, bootstrapping, and on his own in San Francisco. Money is always tight when you have no income.



_&quot;Mate, you&#x27;re looking for a cofounder?&quot;_



_&quot;Yeah but nobody I talked to wants to work for equity&quot;_



Well yeah. You&#x27;re a guy with an idea.



_&quot;Matt, what have you done to prove people will pay for this? Why do you think you&#x27;re ready to build software?&quot;_



Hint: he isn&#x27;t.



## Software is a tool, not a goal



![](https://buffer.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mario1.gif)



Through conversation we discovered that Matt wants to build software because his company doesn&#x27;t feel real without it. You need _something_ that you&#x27;re building. You can&#x27;t just &quot;be a company&quot;.



But you can.



A company isn&#x27;t the software it sells. A company isn&#x27;t the offices. It isn&#x27;t the team. It isn&#x27;t even anything in particular.



A company is a set of processes. A machine.



Some of those processes are encoded in software, some are done by people, some aren&#x27;t even documented. _That_&#x27;s a company. That set of processes and ideas.



Software is just a tool.



What Matt needs are customers. People whose problem his solving. People who are _better people_ because they use his service.



That **service** is what he needs to build. Not some nebulous piece software the definition of which he doesn&#x27;t even know yet.



I dug deeper.



_&quot;Matt, what do you **need**? What&#x27;s blocking you from making your first sale?&quot;_



Well I need a website.



Why?



So I look real when I&#x27;m talking to people. So there&#x27;s something to point them at.



Why?



Because it builds credibility. Without a website I&#x27;m just a random schmo.



Okay that&#x27;s fair. Credibility and authority. You don&#x27;t need a designer or even an engineer for that. You definitely don&#x27;t need to _hire_ anyone. Get an account on square space, carrd, or similar, pick the prettiest template you can find, and fill in your info.



Voila, a website.



You can even hire a freelancer to cobble it together for you. Don&#x27;t waste money on a custom solution until you need one.



Ok there&#x27;s your website, you&#x27;ve got your credibility. What&#x27;s next? Why do you need an engineer, Matt?



Well I need to build the product.



Why?



... because I&#x27;m a product company? Because it isn&#x27;t real without a product?



Why?



Err ...



Matt, did anyone pay you yet? Do you know exactly what they need to make their jobs easier? Have you talked to them?



Well I know they have to fill out a form with 465 fields and reproduce it in triplicate and file it to the right people and it&#x27;s just a mess and super hard and nobody wants to do that.



Okay and you can make it easier with software?



Yes! I can build a beautiful flow and a wonderful UI that guides them through needing just 250 fields it&#x27;s gonna be amazing!



And you need an engineer for that?



Well I can&#x27;t build it myself.



Mate, you need a google form and some customer research. Go sell a shitty version of your product. No code, no software, just your elbow grease and a smile.



## People buy your solution, not your software



People don&#x27;t really care _how_ you solve their problem. They just want somebody to do it for them.



When I hire an accountant to do my taxes, I&#x27;m not buying the software they use, I&#x27;m buying peace of mind. The confidence that I won&#x27;t overpay or underpay and that we&#x27;ll find every legal loophole.



When I pay for Spotify, I&#x27;m paying for ease of access to all the world&#x27;s music. Their software, the player, just needs to be good enough.



When I hire a lawyer to help me get a visa, I don&#x27;t care what they use to make the process easier or their margins higher. I only care that I get my visa and Trump doesn&#x27;t kick me out. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paying for.



And that was my advice to Matt.



**Build the service first**. Solve somebody&#x27;s problem. Make them a better human. **Get paid**.



Then, when you&#x27;re ready, when you feel the inefficiency deep within your bones, _then_ build your software. You&#x27;ll know what you need.
