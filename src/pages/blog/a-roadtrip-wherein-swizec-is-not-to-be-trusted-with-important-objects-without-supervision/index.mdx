## Now what?

I had two options: I could have yelled at him, or we could have calmly retraced our steps. Option one was pointless, so we walked back slowly in the hot summer day. After we asked in everywhere we've been and haven't been and looked everywhere - even on the pirate fortress - it was obvious that we are in fact royally screwed. We looked for the keys two more times, went to the police station. There was a suprising amount of found keys, but not the sheep keychain kind. :( There's not much one can do without car keys in a foreign country. Even the friendly police officer was not sure what to do. Our options were basically:

1.  you can hope and look for the keys some more
2.  you can break in (it is surprisingly easy to find someone who can do that), but the car will remain unlocked and stationary
3.  sem-legally get a new key and hope it can start the car
4.  go to your car dealership about 30 km away and hope for magic
