## FANN

Looking far and wide for a good library to use I stumbled upon [FANN - Fast Artificial Neural Networks](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/).

> Fast Artificial Neural Network Library is a free open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point are supported. It includes a framework for easy handling of [training data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set "Training set") sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast. Bindings to more than [15 programming languages](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/language-bindings/) are available. An easy to read introduction [article](http://fann.sf.net/fann_en.pdf) and a [reference manual](http://leenissen.dk/fann/html/index.html) accompanies the library with examples and recommendations on how to use the library. Several graphical [user interfaces](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/graphical-interface/) are also available for the library.

## Done in a few hours

FANN really saved my skin last night. At least the [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") did. I still haven't solved my problem - trying to predict how many people will read a whole post - but it took me literally a couple of minutes to realize that the same network can't be used to predict two outputs since it won't even converge. That's something very specific to the problem. I also realized the networks were overfitting my data, then performing poorly on the test. Another specific thing. It is because of this incredibly problem-specific nature of most work involving neural networks that having tools like these is really important. Who wants to fiddle around with implementing all this stuff by hand for several hours before even running the first tests? I probably ran twenty or thirty different configurations in the space of three hours last night. Could I have done that without a simple tool? Probably not - wouldn't even have the first configuration implemented by now. Now if only the GUI tool calculated precision and recall instead of mean standard error ...
