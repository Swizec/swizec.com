Different stakeholders care about different things:

- **customers** like software that works
- **leadership** like money and competitive advantage
- **product owners** like to see metrics improve
- **engineers** like code that's easy to change and maintain

The list is in priority order. You'll use different arguments for each, but sometimes you don't need an argument at all. Just start! Shipped code wins.
