<https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/196543519446409216> The other week I was working on my compilers homework - the [semantic analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") part is an object-oriented nightmare. Something called the [visitor pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern "Visitor pattern") to traverse trees and do weird stuff. It made me want to curl up in a fetal position in the corner, rocking back and forth in a padded room, while mumbling tongues at myself. As [River Tam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefly_characters "List of Firefly characters") would say before running out of the room in panic _"Too crowded!"_

## What [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") feels like

![Schizophrenic?](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Summer_Glau_as_River_Tam_in_Serenity_Wallpaper__yvt2-300x225.jpg "Schizophrenic?")![]()\_\_

```ruby
foo: object {
   i: private integer = 0;
   add: function (a:integer) {
      i += a;
      return i;
   }
}

/* lots of code happens here, foo has been passed around, things happened */
/* foo is not a singleton though, just used a lot */

a:integer = foo.add(5);

// What is the value of a?
```

Answering this simple question requires knowing _**everything**_. The whole execution history of _foo_. The whole codebase. You name it, you have to keep it in your head. Oh and did I mention class _bar_? It depends on _foo_ for a lot of its stuff. Oh yeah, they got into a little friends with benefits situation last year. It all gets pretty interesting. I think _bar_ cheated on _foo_ with _[baz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar "Foobar")_ once, though. There's no telling how _foo_ might react to that!

## Functional programming

## A waterfall of data

## Fin

Whatever way you think about your code, whatever way you visualise execution in your head ... hat's off to you, if you can handle the inherent complexity of object-oriented programming. You are a better man than I am. I think you should give "_this functional programming fad"_ a try anyway. You might like it ;)
