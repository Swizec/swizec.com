[![Dubrovnik city walls](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dubrovnik-panorama2mini.jpg "Dubrovnik city walls")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dubrovnik-panorama2mini.jpg) At 9am on Friday, after being awake for twenty-four hours, [@ponywithhiccups](http://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) and I concluded The Roadtrip by collapsing into bed. This morning (Monday) is the first time I woke up actually feeling rested. You know it's been an epic adventure when the hangover lasts for four days! And even though we had to cut it short by a few days because ... money stuff ... it was bloody brilliant! Looking forward to doing something similar again. Soon. But not the drive home ... that was a silly and tiring part. Five cans of Red Bull and one cup of tea and one thirty minute nap tiring. But let's start at the beginning, the [last roadtrip blogpost](http://swizec.com/blog/a-roadtrip-second-leg/swizec/4953 "A roadtrip: second leg") concluded with us arriving in [Dubrovnik](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95 "Old City of Dubrovnik") and setting up a large tent on rocky ground at night. PS: this post turned out a bit long, scroll through at least for the pictures ;)
