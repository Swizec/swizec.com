What do you wanna know about scaling a company 20x in 3 years? Hit reply with your questions.

I'm starting a new book. It's the same book I started almost 2 years ago and didn't finish because it got stuck.

The original idea was to write a book about software rewrites. It didn't work. Too dry, too technical, too boring. Feedback pushed me in a weird textbooky direction and the project evolved into something I wasn't able to create.

Then Manning cancelled the contract and set me free. ðŸ˜…

After 3 months of taking a break, I've figured it out! The book I think you'll want to read.

It's called: **Scaling Fast**, An Engineer's Guide to the Hockeystick.

Ostensibly about lessons learned during a hyper-growth phase of a startup. Paid users grew 20x. Physical locations grew 10x. Employees ... who even knows, it's hard to keep track.

So, what do you wanna know?

If you could talk to an engineer who joined a company with ~7 engineers and held on to the rocketship until ~30 engineers and thousands more users, what would you ask? Here I am, hit reply.

PS: my plan is to finish the manuscript this quarter ðŸ¤ž
