I wrote this poem at a restaurant on Sunday, sipping on hot chai and a cup of chicken soup, waiting for a glorious steak salad to arrive. It was dark â€“ nobody saw that I shed a tear or two. I think. If they did, they didn&#x27;t say anything.The laptop screen lit my face up like a search light. ðŸ¤”It&#x27;s a modern free verse poem. The kind I used to hate in high school because it&#x27;s easy to make. You just write and don&#x27;t give a shit about form or structure. Then you call it a poem.I wasn&#x27;t going to publish it for fear of what people might say. But fuck it, that&#x27;s no way to live a life. What would Amanda Palmer say.

## I&#x27;m tired â€“ a poem

I&#x27;m tired of my job

I&#x27;m tired of my business

I&#x27;m tired of proving myself to US immigration

I&#x27;m tired of proving myself to my boss

I&#x27;m tired of my shitty apartment

and my home office where I can touch both walls

I&#x27;m tired of my coworkers

making noise eating at their desk

I&#x27;m tired of the same lunch time conversations

in the same lunch time spots

at the same lunch time hours

I&#x27;m tired of my routine

I&#x27;m tired of my workouts

I&#x27;m tired of trying to be my best

I always just move my goals

I&#x27;m tired of this city

with its shitty streets

and asphalt cracked so much it makes me fall

I&#x27;m tired of knowing what I&#x27;ll do on Friday when Monday isn&#x27;t even started

I&#x27;m tired of working on the same shit

I&#x27;m tired of making content

I&#x27;m tired of making my name

I&#x27;m tired of ambition

and I&#x27;m tired of knowing that, without ambition, I&#x27;d have nothing

I&#x27;m tired of my girlfriend

I&#x27;m tired of my bird

I&#x27;m tired of delaying gratification

gratification never comes

I&#x27;m tired of seeing happy people and wondering if I&#x27;ll ever be happy, too

tired of knowing that I&#x27;d not feel happy even if I was

I&#x27;m tired of spending my vacations to visit family

I&#x27;m tired of paying for their flights

I&#x27;m tired of doing the thing I&#x27;m supposed to

when all I want is to do anything else

I&#x27;m tired of boring problems

I&#x27;m tired of other&#x27;s shitty code

I&#x27;m tired of being me

and always picking up the pieces

I&#x27;m tired of having everyone&#x27;s backs

when nobody has mine

I&#x27;m tired of feeling like I&#x27;m drowning

with all this weight upon my back

I&#x27;m tired of not knowing how to share the load

because others would just fuck it up

I&#x27;m tired of being responsible

I&#x27;m tired of being there for everyone

I&#x27;m tired of the internet

I&#x27;m tired of feeling all alone

I&#x27;m tired of feeling like I can&#x27;t relate

and like I can&#x27;t write whatever I want

I&#x27;m tired of having an audience

I&#x27;m tired of being an expert

All I want is to do something completely new

Something I&#x27;ve never done before

And learning it all from scratch

With no experience and no responsibility

Just doing something fun for the sake of fun

Wouldn&#x27;t that be nice?

I&#x27;m tired of feeling like I can&#x27;t because I&#x27;d give up everything I always wanted

I&#x27;m tired of being stuck

in this place I fought so hard to get

Stuck in a dream of a life I always wanted

but actually not quite

I am where I want to

Doing what I love

And I&#x27;m tired

Tired of the crap I&#x27;ve piled on

Tired of responsibility

Tired of other people&#x27;s feelings

Tired of being afraid to share this poem

Tired of everything being meh

And life a little bleh

Just, tired
