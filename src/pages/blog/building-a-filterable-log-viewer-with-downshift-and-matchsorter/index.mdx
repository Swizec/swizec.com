This was a fun little build, but I wish I remembered to turn on my stream. It was kinda nice to just write some code, too 😇`<LogViewer>` takes a stream of server logs, or process logs, or any flat text file (let&#x27;s be honest) and turns it into a searchable, filterable little thing. Type in the input box, find what you&#x27;re looking for. Matched strings are highlighted so you know what you&#x27;re doing.

The whole thing fits into 69 lines of beautifully rendered code and 1071 node_modules dependencies. You can [see the code on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/log-viewer) ✌️

[Try &amp;lt;LogViewer&gt;](https://dist-thnnqblnuk.now.sh/)

## Here&#x27;s how it works 👇

`<LogViewer>` is built out of 2 main components:

1. `<LogViewer>` renders a Downshift component and munches a text file into a list of logs
2. `<LogRow>` takes care of individual lines and highlighting matched strings

### LogViewer

We&#x27;re using `getDerivedStateFromProps` to take our `logs`, which is a flat string, and turn it into an array of entries. Right now, that&#x27;s just splitting by newlines, but we could perform contextual parsing and understand that a single log can span multiple lines.

Perhaps the parser function should come from props 🤔

The `render` method takes `logs` from state and returns a `<Downshift>` component. Downshift takes care of driving our input field and some other tidbits that are tedious to do ourselves.

Inside Downshift&#x27;s render prop, we use `matchSorter` to filter logs based on user input. I don&#x27;t know what string matching algorithm matchSorter uses, but it&#x27;s really fast.

A+ library 👌

Finally, we render a `<div>` with an `input` field controlled by Downshift, a `p` with the count of matches, and a `pre` with all our logs in a loop. We render each log entry with `<LogRow>`, providing the current `match` and `log` to be rendered.

### LogRow

The `<LogRow>` component renders a string of text, potentially highlighting a part of it.

We convert the matched string to lower case. Gonna use it to decide which part of the log to highlight.

Then we split our log on a regex using the provided match.

The result is an array of log fragments like this

```undefined
<code>match = 'cat'
log = 'my cat is grumpy'

chunks --> ['my ', 'cat', ' is grumpy']
</code>
```

When you split on regex and wrap your split point in parenthesis, `()`, it&#x27;s preserved in your output. Perfect 👌 for our purposes and pretty fast too.

Rendering is a matter of looping through our `chunks` array and returning either a flat string or the `<Highlighted>` styled component.

The `<Highlighted>` component is simplistic because I&#x27;m no designer.

```undefined
<code>const Highlight = styled.span`
    color: red;
    background: yellow;
`;
</code>
```

Red color, yellow background. High contrast.

## Useful?

That was an MVP. Should I make it better? Should I open source it?

Anyone out there who&#x27;d use it? 🤨 [Ping me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/swizec).
