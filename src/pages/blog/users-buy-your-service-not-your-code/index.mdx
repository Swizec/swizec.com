You might enjoy this podcast episode. [Sylvain and I talked about owning production in a world where AI writes the code](https://rootly.com/humans-of-reliability/swizec-teller).

https://youtu.be/tdcCLv1ZXSw

Also on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n9euSxvGFNfd5PPXgF6oX) and [apple podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/code-is-cheap-reliability-isnt-owning-production-in/id1792427573?i=1000749980553). Pretty neat, I've never been on Spotify before :D

Key topics:

- Why users don’t buy code, they buy reliable services
- The “Feynman computer disease” and AI coding rabbit holes
- Why babysitting AI agents can kill productivity
- The subtle art of writing useful logs
- Debugging distributed systems and redirect loops in production
- Benchmarks for AI SRE agents vs real-world reliability work
- Accountability in engineering (“sign it with your phone number”)
- Why SLAs matter more than how the code was produced
- The future of engineering in a probabilistic, AI-assisted world

Because building a SaaS is easy (always was). But running a SaaS is hard. Owning production is a lot more than writing code and throwing it over the wall.
