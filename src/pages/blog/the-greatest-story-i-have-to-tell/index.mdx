## The Story

After a month of being stuck in a four bedroom house with six guys and only going out once every week or so ... to [Palo Alto](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.4291666667,-122.138055556&spn=0.1,0.1&q=37.4291666667,-122.138055556 (Palo%20Alto%2C%20California)&t=h> "Palo Alto, California"), I needed something better. Palo Alto is where fun goes to die. Marvelous for startups, venture capital just waiting to dump shitloads of money on hapless startups - shake a tree and money falls out. It is a sea of guys. Nerdy, geeky, guys. Whatever girls there are, aren't looking for people like me. Why would they? I haven't cashed out of a startup and I don't even have a car, let alone a Porsche. After a month it was finally time. I'm going to San Francisco and having some proper fun. Researched some clubs on [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com "Google Maps"), asked around a little bit, and found a place I liked - the [DNA Lounge](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7710083333,-122.412694444&spn=0.01,0.01&q=37.7710083333,-122.412694444 (DNA%20Lounge)&t=h> "DNA Lounge"). Looked like a nice alter club with cool music, good people and a lack of gold-diggers. There might even be a girl in there wearing sneakers instead of high heels! Score! Next Saturday I hopped on a bike, cycled to the nearest [Caltrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltrain "Caltrain") station and when I got to San Francisco it was already dark. But hey, what could possibly go wrong? Just a lonesome guy on a bike in a huge city at night!

## An adventure!

## Just keep pedalling.

By this point I was getting very tired. Had been cycling for hours and I'm not in the best of shapes - especially not for cycling. This part of the trip is slightly hazy. I dozed off a couple times, but magically kept pedalling. It was muscle memory by now, didn't even have to think about it. Pedalling? Oh that's just something legs do on their own, not my business. I got to Palo Alto, found the house and at 7am. 1% of battery left. An hour before the first Caltrain leaves from [San Francisco.](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7793,-122.4192&spn=0.1,0.1&q=37.7793,-122.4192 (San%20Francisco)&t=h> "San Francisco") After about two liters of Cedevita and a shower I collapsed into bed. Couldn't think straight to save my life. The next day I was woken up at 10am. It was all hands on deck to help prepare a picnic for all the Silicon Valley friends of the startup. How I survived that day, I'm not sure. All I remember is an all-consuming numbness in my legs and an inability to stand.
