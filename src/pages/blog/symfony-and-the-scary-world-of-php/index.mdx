[![PHP Rockstars](./img/3157-2523296126_77affed9eb.jpg "PHP Rockstars")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23889540@N00/2523296126) One of my clients demanded I do a recent project in [PHP](http://www.php.net "PHP"). Alarm bells all 'round, but hey, I used to do a lot of things in PHP before I got fed up with the inconsistent API and I hear many people still use it. It's clearly a viable technology for ... things. Sure thing mr. Client, I'll do this in PHP for you. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, obviously.

## Modern PHP world

> [Symfony](http://symfony.com/ "Symfony") is an Open Source distributed PHP framework. Of course, when you know how to develop in PHP, you don't need a framework. However, it is very nice to have one!

Get it? Read it again. It's horrible because PHP developers are people who still need to be _convinced_ that letting somebody else worry about the boring stuff is better. Of _course_ they can make everything themselves! Are you questioning their manhood by suggesting a framework? Undeterred, I decided to make my \_"Accept some data from the browser. Calculate three things. Send an email" \_in Symfony. Using Django this would take one afternoon.

## Symfony

## :/

All in all, PHP is still a horrible place to be. Symfony makes it a dash more palatable, it's far from perfect, far from really _really_ useful, but the best I could find. My heart goes to all the programmers stuck in this madness, stay strong! PS: for anyone wondering, I was/am using Symfony 2.1
