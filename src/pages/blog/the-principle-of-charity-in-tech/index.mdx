My favorite part of posting on Reddit is saying _&quot;Hey look at this cool solution to an interesting problem I had&quot;_

And the response is _&quot;This isn&#x27;t a problem&quot;_

Makes you wonder sometimes why you even bother doesn&#x27;t it?

Now between you and me, I&#x27;m used to it and that stuff doesn&#x27;t get me. But what if I wasn&#x27;t? What if that was my first time sharing something cool with the world?

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a newbie sharing some cool technique for the first time.

You get a comment like this

Wow bummer ... you had a curious, albeit weird, problem and you solved it. You share with the world and _&quot;Yeah that&#x27;s dumb, your problem is dumb, and wtf are you even doing!? How is it possible that you would ever need that? Get off my lawn&quot;_

Maybe, just maybe, the author spent a little more time thinking about this than the commenter? ðŸ¤”

What about a comment like this? Remember this is the same article and these are real comments.

So much better!

This commenter still has no idea _why_ you&#x27;d wanna use this technique or what makes it useful, **_but he&#x27;s encouraging_**. Great experimentation! Keep going! Wonderful ðŸ™Œ

See the difference?

Shooting people down on the internet might make you feel cool but that shit&#x27;s weak, my friend. You might think you&#x27;re helping by poking holes in people&#x27;s arguments, but you probably aren&#x27;t.

Not unless you have all the context.

And yes I get it, it&#x27;s up to the author to include enough context. Gotta explain _why_ you built it, _why_ you had the problem, and _then_ how you solved it.

But then there&#x27;s also this meme

You wouldn&#x27;t read a 1000 word backstory anyway. ðŸ˜‰

## The Principle of Charity

Instead, use the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) every time you read an article, have a technical debate, or discuss code with your team.

> In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity or charitable interpretation requires interpreting a speaker&#x27;s statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.

Assume they&#x27;re skilled, assume they had a good reason, assume there&#x27;s constraints you don&#x27;t know about.

Ask questions.

I can almost promise you that the article you&#x27;re reading, the code you&#x27;re reviewing, or the spec you&#x27;re seeing for the first time â€“ the author has spent more time thinking about it than you have.

Respect that.

You aren&#x27;t clever when you point out every flaw.

You&#x27;re not showing off your smarts when you say _&quot;I&#x27;d never have that problem&quot;_.

You&#x27;re not fooling anyone when you say _&quot;I could build that in an afternoon&quot;_

_Helping_ people improve is important. There&#x27;s a time and place to point out flaws, question solutions, and suggest better ideas. But you gotta earn the right to do so. And that requires context.

Anyway I hope you&#x27;re not the kind of person who goes online and shoots people down, calls their ideas dumb, and questions their skills. If you are, please unfollow :P.

Cheers,
