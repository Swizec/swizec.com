1.  Take the outputs from the previous layer (a vector of numbers)
2.  Multiply with a vector of weights (the arrows)
3.  Apply the cost function (this becomes the new layer)

Then you just repeat this for all the layers and that's that. That is literally all that happens. In the end you are left with a vector of numbers representing the output layer, which you then just have to correctly interpret. The part I don't have completely figured out yet is the backpropagation. This is the bit where neural networks learn how to do their magic. Basically backpropagations sets those weights from step 2 via a simple [hill climbing algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing "Hill climbing") ... it is essentially a way to calculate the gradient of the cost function so that you can correctly change the weights to achieve ever lower differences between what you're supposed to know and what you actually know. Eventually you hope to achieve a [global minimum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima "Maxima and minima"), but you are guaranteed to at least achieve a local minimum and not being able to tell whether it's global. That's it. That is really all there is to it. Neural networks are just a nice way to visualise a sequence of matrix multiplications. And I guess it's easier to get grants for "neural networks" than "sequence of matrix multiplications" ...
