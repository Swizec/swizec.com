Children of Men is a bloody brilliant movie that the above trailer doesn't quite do justice. It is quite simply the best dystopian/post-apocalyptic story my brain has ever had the pleasure of encountering.

The story revolves around the idea of what would happen if the whole world turned to chaos, humanity was doomed and only England of all places, remained standing against the onslaught of turmoil. The best part is that the whole sequence of events and what exactly is going on is never quite explained. We're told that the world started going haywire because of some sort of flu pandemic in 2008 - note the movie was made in 2006 and we had a bird flu scare in 2008 - and then in 2009 all women went sterile ... fortunately, this hasn't happened in real life yet.

The movie fast-forwards to 18 years after humans couldn't reproduce anymore. Inexplicably there is a civil war developing about the rights of immigrants and the entire British government is being strongly Orwellian in operation. Interestingly, they're becoming more and more Orwellian in real life as well.

Children of Men, next to the the wonderful story, also features
