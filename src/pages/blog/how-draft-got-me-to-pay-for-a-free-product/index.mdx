[Draft](https://draftin.com/) is a marvelous new webservice for writing. A bit like iA Writer, but for the browser. I [love](http://swizec.com/blog/stypi-the-perfect-blogging-tool/swizec/3312) [distraction-free](http://swizec.com/blog/cool-thing-thursday-ia-writer/swizec/5517) writing and I&#x27;ve recently come to rely on Draft for writing my blog posts. It&#x27;s simply the best writing tool out there that I can use with my [fancy keyboard](http://swizec.com/blog/cool-thing-thursday-a-300-euro-keyboard/swizec/5690) (linux, no iA Writer, bad wrists). But I&#x27;m not here today to talk about the marvelous version control features, the fact I can click the equivalent of &quot;Save back to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress")&quot; when I&#x27;m done writing, or even the &quot;Get feedback from an expert&quot; feature. No, today I want to tell you about the brilliant trick Nathan Kontny used to convert me from a freeloader to the proud owner of a $4 monthly subscription. I login one day, right from the WordPress dashboard (Chrome extension), and what do I see if not a big pop up sort of thing saying &quot;Hey, you should totally subscribe!&quot;. As a geek and a nerd I find these things tacky, overdone, and rather pushy. But this was different. There was no blackout, no flashing colours, just a friendly message from the founder saying &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m making this thing and I need your help to keep it awesome.&quot;. More \\importantly, _he started a conversation_! ![Draft asks me to sign up](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/c89bJzgRlerjCMR6C1ME) Sidenote: Wow, I was just delighted by how easy inserting an image is. Shift+Ctrl+I, drag image into browser. Beautiful. _khem_ See, it&#x27;s not a pushy sales thing, it&#x27;s an honest ask. If you don&#x27;t want to, that&#x27;s fine too, but please tell me why. I was instantly convinced. Left a message saying how awesome I find the service and _how infinitely brilliant is the fact I can reply to a &quot;please subscribe message&quot;_. Later that day I kept my promise and subscribed. Better still, later that day I got a reply. ![Draft replies](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/agNbhVprQoSZAjZaeIau) You have no idea how delighted I am by this little exchange. And now I&#x27;m spending $4 a month on something I use maybe twice a week for maybe an hour to indulge in what is a glorified hobby. In comparison, I pay $5 a month for [Toggl](http://www.toggl.com "Toggl.com") - the basis of thousands of dollars worth of invoices, I use [Github](http://github.com "GitHub") daily and don&#x27;t pay a dime ... actually I don&#x27;t pay for most things I spend my whole days on. Good job Draft, you&#x27;re doing something right. This is probably the biggest bang for buck a service has ever gotten out of me.
