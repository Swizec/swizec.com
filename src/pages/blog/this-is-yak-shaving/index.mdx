I sat down to write about a rendering technique I use to quickly wrap random D3 code in React components. I call them &quot;blackbox components&quot; because they&#x27;re a black box.



It&#x27;s already a chapter in [React+D3v4](https://gumroad.com/l/mTWg) and a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/swizec/pen/woNjVw). How hard can it be to write a post?



Then I thought, _”This is dumb. People shouldn&#x27;t keep rewriting this. It should be an npm module.”_



So I started making a library.



Then I remembered that [compiling](https://swizec.com/blog/livecoding-19-its-hard-to-package-a-library/swizec/6927) [libraries](https://swizec.com/blog/livecoding-21-use-babel-for-libraries-not-webpack/swizec/6982) sucks.



So I went to copy config files from an [old transition library I did](https://github.com/Swizec/react-transitionable-component). But the files were old and out of date. Possibly copied from a 0.2.x version of `create-react-app`.



Terrible.



So I looked for a `create-react-lib` because the `-app` version creates too much stuff that libraries don&#x27;t need. Like all the setup for `index.html` and assets and webpack dev and webpack prod and eslint and jest and a default app page and…



Couldn&#x27;t find one. Used `create-react-app`, ejected, copied config files, removed the parts I don&#x27;t need.



30 minutes in: no post, no library, but I’ve got the config I need to get started.



So I copied the code from CodePen and cleaned it up and added some imports and exports. Made it Real Code™.



Then I thought, _&quot;You know, this technique can work for things that aren&#x27;t SVG. There&#x27;s plenty of stuff people might wanna use.&quot;_



So I added a version that uses `<div>` instead of `<g>`.



Then I compiled. `node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel.js src --out-dir lib`. It worked! ?



Now, how do I test this? ?



So I started writing an example project. Create react app and all of that. `npm link` to use unpublished library. Neat trick, that.



I started with the same axis example from CodePen. `import BlackboxSvgHOC`, use it to make an `Axis` component, render in an `<svg>`.



Error. Files not found.



Investigate, find a typo in the filename, fix, reload, renders default React app.

Waitaminute! Where&#x27;s my example axis? How am I gonna add more awesome examples if I can&#x27;t even load an axis?



Sigh. There&#x27;s a nasty error in the console. Pretty sure I&#x27;ve never seen that one before.

How do you even debug that? ?



So I went to play Dirt3 for 20 minutes. To regain focus, ya know.



Then I wrote this story. And I wish I was kidding, but it took me an hour. Twitter is distracting.



3 hours after I started: no article, no library, no working code, no example project.



This is [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). Don&#x27;t do this.
