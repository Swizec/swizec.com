Lately I&#x27;ve been spending my evenings and nights working on a super secret and above awesome project that I will talk about ... soon, when it&#x27;s a bit more ready. _tl; dr -&gt; [github link to source](https://github.com/Swizec/node-unshortener)_ That project deals mostly with [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter") and harnessing url&#x27;s from the stream. As anyone who&#x27;s sniffed at Twitter lately can atest, therea re many, many _many_ strange urls floating around, using any number of [url shortening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening "URL shortening") schemes or what seems to have become quite fashionable, a custom domains that are shortenered via services nobody could guess at. But when you&#x27;re trying to do something useful with these it&#x27;s usually much easier when you have the original url to work with. Especially when it comes to doing things for specific domains. What&#x27;s needed is some sort of library that can unshort pretty much any url you throw at it. Surely someone has already made one right? Turns out, outside of a few services, no such thing existed ... and I didn&#x27;t want to use a third party service. Naturally I set out to make my own library for unshortening short links. You can check out the source [on github](https://github.com/Swizec/node-unshortener).

## Example

It&#x27;s pretty simple to use, only has one function you should care about :)

```
var unshortener = require('unshortener');

// you can pass in a url object or string
unshortener.expand('http://fb.me/UXVqinvO',
                   function (url) {
                       console.log(url.href);

		       // prints: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=514346&l=30b4ab9bbd&id=132853273433650
                   });
```

## Simple logic

The approach is pretty simple:

- take a url
- check if known service
- know it --&gt; use an [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface")
- wtf --&gt; pretend to be a browser

As you can see, the library is pretty simple, just 68 sloc of [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") code. But simple solutions are good solutions I&#x27;m told and this little thing does everything I need it to do. Right now it directly supports only bit.ly and is.gd, so if you know of any more shorteners with an expand API please tell me so I can add them. Following redirects is a bit messy and I&#x27;d prefer to do as much as possible through official API&#x27;s.
