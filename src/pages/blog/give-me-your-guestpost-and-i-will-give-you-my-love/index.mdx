![A cute hedgehog](./img/NeGxI.png "A cute hedgehog")

Next week is going to be rather busy. Three (possibly four) exams and giving a short talk ... that needs to be prepared, delivered and the resulting lady fans wooed.

You know how it goes.

I don't want to go into radio silence for a whole week. Writing crappy quickies all week is severely undesirable as well.

SO,

if you've got _anything_ to say, anything at all, say it here.

Write a guest post for this site on anything ranging from science, to tea and the startup world. I'm not particularly picky, but I want to feel a human voice (as opposed to a generic marketing post spam)

Why would you do that? Because:

1.  You shall win my eternal gratitude. I will owe you **two** not one (favour, blogpost, whatever)
2.  Your post will land in ~800 adoring RSS readers
3.  I'm going to tweet your post exactly three times. That gets a reader or two
4.  I will lovingly spoon feed your post to all 1700 of my G+ humans
5.  Did I mention I'm going to love you forever?

If that isn't enough to convince you, I have attached a cute hedgehog. You can't say no to something _that_ cute. Fact.
