![A cute hedgehog](./img/NeGxI.png "A cute hedgehog")\_\_

1.  You shall win my eternal gratitude. I will owe you **two** not one (favour, blogpost, whatever)
2.  Your post will land in ~800 adoring RSS readers
3.  I'm going to tweet your post exactly three times. That gets a reader or two
4.  I will lovingly spoon feed your post to all 1700 of my G+ humans
5.  Did I mention I'm going to love you forever?

If that isn't enough to convince you, I have attached a cute hedgehog. You can't say no to something _that_ cute. Fact.
