My code has never looked so beautiful!

Monitor reviews are a very visual affair. Watch the video üëÜ



Got my [LG UltraFine 5K 27&quot; from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD). Mine was a refurb, so I saved about $500 from full price. Your luck may vary.



Here&#x27;s a quick rundown for the impatient üëá

**Pros**



- gorgeous picture
- **so many** pixels 5120x2880
- seriously, my code looks like it&#x27;s printed on paper üòç
- one cable to rule them all (same cable charges your laptop and connects everything)
- 3 USB-C ports, works as a hub
- USB-C connection should have enough bandwidth for a lot of peripherals
- _amazing_ built-in speakers, no more muffled bassy sound
- okay webcam
- adjustable height and 2-directional tilt
- light yet sturdy
- design looks üëå



**Cons**



- USB-C only, you need to buy a hub (I got one with USB + ethernet + SDcards, duct-taped it to the back)
- doesn&#x27;t seem to adjust brightness to ambient light
- 13&quot; macbook pro from 2017 struggles a bit
- 15&quot; macbook pro with top spec GPU can&#x27;t run games in full 5K
- too many pixels, gotta be careful when taking screenshots (must resize, big files)
- super expensive
- completely unnecessary for most daily tasks
- MacOS sometimes does wonky things with USB-C connections like crash your computer if you plug and unplug impatiently
- doesn&#x27;t give you more screen real estate room than a normal 27&quot; monitor (not at &quot;native&quot; resolution at least)



The reason I went for 5K instead of just 4K are the Amazon reviews that say _&quot;Don&#x27;t get a 27&quot; 4K, MacOS does funny things&quot;_. Something about not being able to run at native resolution so you either get suuuuuper tiny visuals, or everything&#x27;s blurry.



Your only options are a 24&quot; 4K or a 27&quot; 5K. I hear 32&quot; 4K works great too, but my desk isn&#x27;t big enough.



**Verdict**



2017 is still too early for 5K. There are only 2 monitors on the market, [the LG](http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD) and the Dell, and they&#x27;re both expensive as hell. Laptops have trouble driving the full resolution for anything interesting, and you don&#x27;t get more real estate than normal.



It&#x27;s a fancy toy, looks great, your eyes will love you. But if you have a working monitor, I&#x27;d wait a few more years for 5K to become the norm.
