1.  People are a **lot** nicer than you think. Walk up to someone with a smile and something positive to say, you are _guaranteed \_nice things will happen. Nobody will get annoyed, it will \_not_ get awkward or weird. Girls especially react well to this, even if you very bluntly say they just look cute.
2.  I notice people more. The city is no longer a nameless faceless mass of humans rushing past each other, there is some small interesting thing about almost everybody. Some of them are even worth mentioning.

All of this might sound touchy feely and kind of lame, but I think not enough people realize they're awesome. If I'm not doing some big startup, I should at least be making the world a better place one simple compliment at a time. And you never know where a chance interaction might take you. Some random guy might actually be a big VC just looking for someone like me. Or a girl desperately wanting some company ... or a business owner who needs a freelancer.
