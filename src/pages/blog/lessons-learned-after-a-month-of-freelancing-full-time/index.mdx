[![Look around, by Ev0luti0nary](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8429/7867540240_37b9926b8b_z.jpg "Look around, by Ev0luti0nary")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ev0luti0nary/7867540240/) A month ago I decided to [stop thinking of myself as a student](http://swizec.com/blog/on-becoming-a-college-dropout/swizec/5315), launched a [sole proprietor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship "Sole proprietorship") type of business and dived into [freelancing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer "Freelancer") [full time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time "Full-time"). Starting out I imagined vast riches, clients fighting tooth and nail to book me and fighting off uninteresting projects with torch and pitchfork. After all, that was my experience before going full time. I've since discovered a few things. Luckily** lead generation** is simple as ever. While my blog has all but dried up as a lead generator because of lessened traffic, having a well connected friend or two really helped in getting introduced to people who might need my help. Posting on the monthly HackerNews _Seeking Freelancer_ converted two or three times. I've heard good things of oDesk and might start using it. Note to self: start measuring conversion rates for introductions. Important stuff.

## Everything takes too damn long

1.  Get lead
2.  Send email
3.  Wait two days for reply
4.  Agree on [Skype](http://skype.com "Skype") meeting
5.  Reschedule Skype meeting 3+ times
6.  Skype chat &lt;a week later>
7.  Negotiate basic contract
8.  Sign contract &lt;2 weeks later>
9.  Receive tasks &lt;3 weeks later>

Usually this wasn't a problem. I had plenty of things to keep me busy and could barely keep up with the speed of interaction myself. Honestly, I didn't even notice it took that long and there were so many steps! Now? Well ... heh ... now _eeeeverything is paaaainstaikingly sloooooooow_. So very very slow. Two or three days to reply? Are you daft man! I want this project tomorrow, get cracking immediately. My coding fingers are twitching with excitement! Oh and let's not forget many projects don't even make it through all those stages. Some fall off because they can't afford me, others scrape whole projects after a pivot, some find a local freelancer and feel that might be easier to work with. Out of ten leads, three might come to a signed contract and some actual work. And yes, I do need to optimize those steps and, indeed, start measuring what the drop-off rate actually is.

## Lost in time

## Getting paid

While they can afford to take forever, I simply don't have that sort of runway. Take on more projects in the meantime? Of course. Eventually get swamped when everything goes through at once? Naturally. Being a full time freelancer is tricky, but I love it completely.
