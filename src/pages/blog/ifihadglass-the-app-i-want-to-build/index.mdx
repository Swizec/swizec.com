For about a year now [Google](http://google.com "Google") has been teasing us with its [wearable computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_computer "Wearable computer") idea - Glass. And for just as long, people have been making fun of the concept. Calling it anything from utterly ridiculous, to a despicable invasion into everybody's privacy. The [running joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_gag "Running gag") on the internet is that you should walk up to anyone wearing Google Glass and shout _"Ok, Glass, google lemon party. Open all."_ [![longboard-glass-app](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/longboard-glass-app.jpg "longboard-glass-app")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/longboard-glass-app.jpg) Some have gone as far as calling it a useless idea that does nothing more than a [smartphone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone") can already do for you.

> No to throw cold water here but Is it really? It seems to be rather trivial integration of currently known and available technologies with bit of miniaturization efforts. Nothing that 5 year old iPhone can't do with albeit more convenience. Space elevators, 100% artificial life form, fusion reactor of the size AA batteries - now that, my friend, would be sci-fi stuff.
