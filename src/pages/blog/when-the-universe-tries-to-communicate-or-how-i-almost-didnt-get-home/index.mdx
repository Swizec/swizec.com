## Your hands are explosive and your bags are too heavy (SFO)

_"Hi friendly check-in person. Here is my bag."_ _"Too heavy."_ _"Yeah sure, it's a big bag. How much is the surcharge?"_ _"\\\\\$60, but it's too heavy ..."_ _"You wot?"_ _"Your bag can't be heavier than 32kg. This is 38. Hmmmm ... what can you do ... well you **could** pay for an extra bag. That's \\\\\$95"_ _"Ok sure, let's do that."_ She just looks at me. She keeps looking. _"Sir, the bag is too heavy. You have to make it lighter. Nobody will handle this lest they injure themselves."_ _"Wait ... you're saying I have to buy an extra bag? Like physically an extra bag?"_ _"Yes."_ Screw that then! I'm buying a carry-on suitcase. If I'm buying an extra bag anyway, I sure as hell am not going to pay for double luggage as well. Run to the suitcase store at the airport. Hi, yes, I'll have that bag please. Here's my card. _"Sir, we don't accept that."_ Fuck! No money on my Visa. The only thing they take. Run to an ATM. Shove my business card down its throat. _"We can't help you with this amount or account."_ Find out there's a more international ATM downstairs. Run to the lift with this huge monster of a suitcase. Find the ATM. There's a woman, slouched over so much she looked like she was climbing into the machine. Takes five attempts to make sure that when the ATM says _"Your daily limit reached"_, it's not lying. Getting very antsy by now. Yes! This machine gives me money. Hooray! Run back up. Buy suitcase. Frantically throw the heaviest things from big suitcase into small suitcase. I must've looked like a joke. Run back to the check-in. 28kg! Throw a few things back in the big suitcase. Check-in. _"Ok sir. Your bags are checked to Vienna and I put a priority stamp on your boarding pass because we start boarding in ten minutes."_ U wot m8? Mad dash to security. _"What's in your back pocket sir?"_ _"Uh ... nothing?"_ _"The scanner shows me there's something."_ _"Well I found this penny. Does that count?"_ _"Ok. But now you've touched yourself. We have to scan your hands"_ ... Beep beep beep. _"Your hands tested positive for explosives. Please step to this counter. No, don't help us carry your stuff. Don't touch anything. Stand behind that wall."_ Errr ... okay. They then swiped everything with these little paper slips. My messenger bag. My shoes. My hat. My jacket. My carry-on suitcase that's been mine for exactly 20 minutes. Everything. Even my wallet. _"Okay sir. Everything checks out here. Now if you would please follow us to the private pad down area."_ Them's scary words right there! Images of dark rooms with strong in-the-face lighting flash in my mind. Just like in the movies. _"I'm missing my flight aren't I?"_ _"Nah you're good. This only takes ten minutes."_ The private room was really just a small area of the security walled off with darkened glass walls. It had only a door, a small chair, a table, and a mat for a person to stand on. Nothing imposing. Nothing terrifying. A friendly man walked in and spent two minutes just explaining where he would touch me. He would use his open palms to go over my arms and body. He would go up and down the inside of my leg four times. He would use the back of his hands to fondle my buttcheeks. He would drag is palm horizontally across my groin five times. He would touch my feet. He did all that. I did not get an erection. Honestly, this whole tested positive for explosives was my most positive experience with TSA (or similar) ever. Everyone was very cordial. They were nice. The guy who fondled me even kept me company while I got all my stuff back together. We talked about the Austrian castle where The Sound of Music was filmed. He was very impressed that you can just see it from the Autobahn and waxed poetic about how cool it is that I only live about a two hour drive away. That's nearby to Americans. I made it to my flight 10 minutes before take-off.
