Someone (I won't say it was metron) notified me today via a lovely PM that [Marc Tauss](http://www.marctauss.com/flash.html) a.k.a metron has a new [website](http://www.marctauss.com/flash.html) with his, if I can be the judge, amazingly awesome art. It features his photo illustrations, a style I've always adored, and apparently some other stuff. You should check it out.
