That’s a particle generator. It makes tiny circles fly out of where you click. Hold down your mouse and move around. The particles keep flying out of your cursor.

On mobile and only have a finger? That works, too.

I’m a nerd, so this is what I consider fun. Your mileage may vary. Please do click in the embed and look at those circles fly. Ain’t it cool?

## Here’s how it works

The whole thing is built with React, Redux, and d3. No tricks for animation; just a bit of cleverness.

Here’s the general approach:

We use **React to render everything**: the page, the SVG element, the particles inside. All of it is built with React components that take some props and return some DOM. This lets us tap into React’s algorithms that decide which nodes to update and when to garbage collect old nodes.

Then we use some **d3 calculations and event detection**. D3 has great random generators, so we take advantage of that. D3’s mouse and touch event handlers calculate coordinates relative to our SVG. We need those, and React can’t do it. React’s click handlers are based on DOM nodes, which don’t correspond to `(x, y)` coordinates. D3 looks at real cursor position on screen.

All **particle coordinates are in a Redux store**. Each particle also has a movement vector. The store holds some useful flags and general parameters, too. This lets us treat animation as data transformations. I’ll show you what I mean in a bit.

We use **actions to communicate user events** like creating particles, starting the animation, changing mouse position, and so on. On each requestAnimationFrame, we **dispatch an “advance animation” action**.

On each action, the **reducer calculates a new state** for the whole app. This includes **new particle positions** for each step of the animation.

When the store updates, **React flushes changes** via props and because **coordinates are state, the particles move**.

The result is smooth animation.

Keep reading to learn the details. The [code is also on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment).

A version of this article will be featured as a chapter in my upcoming [React+d3js ES6 book](https://swizec.com/reactd3js/).

## 3 presentation components

We’ll start with the presentation components because they’re the least complicated. To render a collection of particles, we need:

- a stateless `Particle`
- a stateless `Particles`
- a proper `App`

None of them contain state, but `App` has to be a proper component so that we can use `componentDidMount`. We need it to attach d3 event listeners.

The `Particle` component is a circle. It looks like this:

```javascript
// src/components/Particles/Particle.jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';

const Particle = ({ x, y }) => (
    <circle cx={x} cy={y} r="1.8"></circle>
);

Particle.propTypes = {
    x: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    y: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

export default Particle;
```

It takes `x` and `y` coordinates and returns an SVG circle.

The `Particles` component isn’t much smarter – it returns a list of circles wrapped in a grouping element, like this:

```javascript
// src/components/Particles/index.jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';

import Particle from './Particle';

const Particles = ({ particles }) => (
    <g>{particles.map(particle =>
        <Particle key={particle.id} {...particle}="">
        )}
    </Particle></g>
);

Particles.propTypes = {
    particles: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
        id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        x: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        y: PropTypes.number.isRequired
    }).isRequired).isRequired
};

export default Particles;
```

Note that `key={particle.id}` part. React complains endlessly without it. I think it’s used to tell similar components apart, which makes the fancy algorithms work.

Cool. Given an array of `{id, x, y}` objects, we can render our SVG circles. Now comes our first fun component: the `App`.

`App` takes care of rendering the scene and attaching d3 event listeners. The rendering part looks like this:

```javascript
// src/components/index.jsx

import React, { PropTypes, Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import d3 from 'd3';

import Particles from './Particles';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Header from './Header';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div onMouseDown={() => this.props.startTicker()} style={{overflow: 'hidden'}}>
                 <Header />
                 <svg width={this.props.svgWidth} height={this.props.svgHeight} ref="svg" style={{background: 'rgba(124,224,249,.3)'}}>
                     <Particles particles={this.props.particles} />
                 </svg>
                 <Footer n={this.props.particles.length} />
             </div>
        );
    }
}

App.propTypes = {
    svgWidth: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    svgHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    startTicker: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    startParticles: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    stopParticles: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    updateMousePos: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};

export default App;
```

There’s more going on, but the gist is that we return a `<div>` with a `Header`, a `Footer`, and an `<svg>`. Inside `<svg>`, we use `Particles` to render many circles. Don’t worry about the Header and Footer; they’re text.

Notice that the core of our rendering function only says _“Put all Particles here, please”_. There’s nothing about what’s moved, what’s new, or what’s no longer needed. We don’t have to worry about that.

We get a list of coordinates and naively render circles. React takes care of the rest. If you ask me, that’s the real magic here.

Oh, and we call `startTicker()` when a user clicks on our scene. No reason to have the clock running _before_ any particles exist.

### D3 event listeners

To let users generate particles, we have to wire up those functions we mentioned in `propTypes`. It looks like this:

```javascript
// src/components/index.jsx

class App extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        let svg = d3.select(this.refs.svg);

        svg.on('mousedown', () => {
            this.updateMousePos();
            this.props.startParticles();
        });
        svg.on('touchstart', () => {
            this.updateTouchPos();
            this.props.startParticles();
        });
        svg.on('mousemove', () => {
            this.updateMousePos();
        });
        svg.on('touchmove', () => {
            this.updateTouchPos();
        });
        svg.on('mouseup', () => {
            this.props.stopParticles();
        });
        svg.on('touchend', () => {
            this.props.stopParticles();
        });
        svg.on('mouseleave', () => {
            this.props.stopParticles();
        });

    }

    updateMousePos() {
        let [x, y] = d3.mouse(this.refs.svg);
        this.props.updateMousePos(x, y);
    }

    updateTouchPos() {
        let [x, y] = d3.touches(this.refs.svg)[0];
        this.props.updateMousePos(x, y);
    }
}
```

There are some events to think about:

- `mousedown` and `touchstart` turn on particle generation
- `mousemove` and `touchmove` update the mouse location
- `mouseup`, `touchend`, and `mouseleave` turn off particle generation

Then you have `updateMousePos` and `updateTouchPos`, which use d3’s magic to calculate new `(x, y)` coordinates relative to our SVG element. The particle generation step uses this data as each particle’s initial position.

Yes, it’s complicated.

Remember, React isn’t smart enough to figure out mouse position relative to our drawing area. React knows that we clicked a DOM node. [D3 does the magic](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/src/event/mouse.js) to find exact coordinates.

For touch events, we only consider the first touch’s position. We _could_ let users shoot particles out of multiple fingers at once, but there’s enough going on as it is.

That’s it for the rendering and the user events. [107 lines of code](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment/blob/master/src/components/index.jsx).

## 6 Actions

Redux actions are a fancy way of saying _“Yo, a thing happened!”_. They’re functions you call to get structured metadata about what’s up.

We have 6 actions. The most complicated one looks like this:

```javascript
// src/actions/index.jsx
export const CREATE_PARTICLES = "CREATE_PARTICLES";

export function createParticles(N, x, y) {
  return {
    type: CREATE_PARTICLES,
    x: x,
    y: y,
    N: N,
  };
}
```

It tells the system to create `N` particles at `(x, y)` coordinates. You’ll see how that works when we look at the Reducer, and you’ll see how it triggers when we look at the Container.

Actions _must_ have a `type`. Reducers use the type to decide what to do.

[Our other actions](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment/blob/master/src/actions/index.js) are `tickTime`, `tickerStarted`, `startParticles`, `stopParticles`, and `updateMousePos`. You can guess what they mean :)

## 1 Container component

Containers are React components much like the presentation bits. Unlike presentation components, containers talk to the redux data store.

I’m not sure this separation is strictly necessary, but it does make your code look nice. You have functionally clean presentation components that turn properties into elements, and dirty, dirty containers that talk to the outside world.

You can think of them as data store monads if it helps.

The gist of our `AppContainer` looks like this:

```javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import App from '../components';
import { tickTime, tickerStarted, startParticles, stopParticles, updateMousePos, createParticles } from '../actions';

class AppContainer extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        const { store } = this.context;
        this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
            this.forceUpdate()
        );
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
        this.unsubscribe();
    }

   // ...

    render() {
        const { store } = this.context;
        const state = store.getState();

        return (
            <App {...state} 
                 startTicker={this.startTicker.bind(this)} 
                 startParticles={this.startParticles.bind(this)} 
                 stopParticles={this.stopParticles.bind(this)} 
                 updateMousePos={this.updateMousePos.bind(this)}
            />
        );
    }
};

AppContainer.contextTypes = {
    store: React.PropTypes.object
};

export default AppContainer;
```

We import stuff, then we define `AppContainer` as a proper React `Component`. We need to use lifecycle methods, which aren’t available in stateless components.

There are three important parts in this code:

1.  We wire up the store in `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`. Subscribe to data changes on mount, unsubscribe on unmount.
2.  When rendering, we assume the store is our context, use `getState()`, then render the component we’re wrapping. In this case, we render the `App` component.
3.  To get the store as our context, we _have to_ define `contextTypes`. It won’t work otherwise. This is deep React magic.

Contexts are nice because they let us implicitly pass properties. The context can be anything, but Redux prefers it be the store. That contains _everything_ about application state – both UI and business data.

That’s where the monad comparison comes from … my foray into Haskell may have broken me. I see monads everywhere.

In case you were wondering, that `{this.startTicker.bind(this)}` syntax is a way to bind the function to the current context. 

### AppContainer talks to the store

Great, you know the basics. Now we need to define those callbacks so `App` can trigger actions. Most are boilerplate-y action wrappers. Like this:

```javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx
    startParticles() {
        const { store } = this.context;
        store.dispatch(startParticles());
    }

    stopParticles() {
        const { store } = this.context;
        store.dispatch(stopParticles());
    }

    updateMousePos(x, y) {
        const { store } = this.context;
        store.dispatch(updateMousePos(x, y));
    }
```

That’s boilerplate. The action function gives us that `{type: ..}` object, and we dispatch it on the store.

When that happens, Redux uses our reducer to create a new instance of the state tree. We’ll talk more about that in the next section.

First, we have to look at the `startTicker` callback. It’s where our magic begins.

```javascript
    startTicker() {
        const { store } = this.context;

        let ticker = () => {
            if (store.getState().tickerStarted) {
                this.maybeCreateParticles();
                store.dispatch(tickTime());

                window.requestAnimationFrame(ticker);
            }
        };

        if (!store.getState().tickerStarted) {
            console.log("Starting ticker");
            store.dispatch(tickerStarted());
            ticker();
        }
    }
```

Oof. Don’t worry if you don’t “get” this immediately. It took me a few hours to create.

This drives our animation loop. Some might call it the game loop.

It dispatches the `tickTime` action on every `requestAnimationFrame`. Every time the browser is ready to render, we get a chance to update our Redux data store. In theory, that’s 60 times a second, but it depends on many factors. Look it up.

`startTicker` updates the store in two steps:

1.  Check
