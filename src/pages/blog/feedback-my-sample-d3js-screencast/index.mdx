Packt convinced me to bite the [d3.js](http://protovis.org/ "D3.js") bullet once more. Following the \[hugely successful?] [Data Visualization with d3.js book](http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-with-d3js/book), I am now working on a video course aimed at advanced users. It&#x27;s going to be chock full of going into details about layouts, data manipulation, geography and other fun stuff. Definitely none of that _&quot;This is how you place a [SVG](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ "Scalable Vector Graphics") element. This is how you bind data to elements. This is how you ...&quot;_ Snore. Pretty much all d3.js screencasts and courses I was able to find focus on beginners. There will be none of that here, I&#x27;m going to assume you&#x27;ve made at least three things with d3.js before tackling my videos. So roughly the same experience I&#x27;ve got. That said, I made a sample screencast last week to test the process out. The topic will fit towards the end of the course, where I try to explain the design part of visualisations. Now, this is my first ever recording of a screencast. I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing. _Do not_ be gentle! If there&#x27;s something wrong, I have to know. _Now!_ If you tell me I suck six months from now when the course is published, it will be too late. Tell me my accent sucks, now. Tell me I speak at a funny pace, now. Tell me you can&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying, now. And tell me I need a better mic. Then suggest which one I should get because this was recorded on the default apple headphones microphone. Also, I&#x27;m going to need volunteers to beta read my scripts and beta watch the videos. The schedule says scripts will be coming out at a decent cadence of one every two weeks over the next two months. Then I&#x27;ll be making the screencasts themselves over summer and the course should be out in September. I&#x27;m making this for you guys. Help me make it awesomer.
