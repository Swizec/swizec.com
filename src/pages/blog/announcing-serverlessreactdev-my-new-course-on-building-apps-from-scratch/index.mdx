Today I'm thrilled to announce my new course [ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev) on building webapps with the hyper productive modern stack.

You're a brilliant engineer, {% if subscriber.first_name != blank %} {{ subscriber.first_name }} {% else %} my friend {% endif %}. Great at your job. Someone gives you a spec and **you get it done**. Bam ðŸ’ª

But can you ship a product on your own?

Usually you work with others. They're slow. They're busy. There's meetings. Committees. Pull requests. Managers. Approvals. So much work about work that _doesn't deliver value to users_.

Every little thing involves a designer, a JavaScript expert, a CSS professional, a backend engineer, a database person, the QA team, the devops folks, the ...

It takes you _months_ to turn a star button into a like button.

Ugh.

What if you could _grab an idea by the horns_ and **build the damn thing**? Own a feature from start to finish?

That's why I created [ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev)

[ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev) is a video course that shows you how to build a modern webapp from scratch to launch using the hyper productive modern web stack.

You'll learn everything you need to **become a fullstack frontend engineer.**

[ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev) is focused on practical examples and showing you the whole process. Warts and all.

When you follow a polished tutorial, you learn how to build _that_ thing. But your skills don't transfer. And when something goes wrong, you're stuck.

With [ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev) you get a behind-the-scenes look. I'll show you how to debug problems, how to design a solution, where to start, and when to say good enough.

Learn **the pragmatic way to build modern apps**.

We start with some theory, learn the stack, do some practical exercises to get a feel for technologies, _then build a whole app_. From a list of features to accepting payments.

## What's in ServerlessReact.Dev

ServerlessReact.Dev covers the new technologies that represent **the future of web development**. Get ahead of this **exciting new paradigm shift**.

â€“ Learn how to build blazing fast **static-first React apps** with Gatsby

â€“ Learn how to **use GraphQL** to minimize API requests

â€“ Leverage **design systems** to build beautiful apps without designers

â€“ **Serverless** technologies for adding functionality on the server

â€“ **Store and manage data** in a database

â€“ **Payments** integration

â€“ **Authenticate** users and keep track of their accounts

â€“ **JAMStack** deployments for production-ready frontend code

â€“ The **Edge First Architecture** for frontend state management using React Hooks

I want to show you everything you need to build blazing fast static-first webapps and launch a successful product on the side. And if you don't want to launch products, these techniques will streamline your workflow at the day job.

**YOU** can build the whole thing. Whatever it is.

And just this week, [ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev/) is $100 off until Jan 31st.

Start owning ideas like a pro ðŸ‘‰ [ServerlessReact.Dev](https://serverlessreact.dev/)

Cheers,

PPS: I built an entire new course platform just for ServerlessReact.Dev and I couldn't have done it without the modern stack
