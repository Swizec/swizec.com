Here are a few engineering principles I aim to instill in every team I join. Lead or not.

1. **PRs are work**, not a favor. The velocity of your code review is a leading indicator of software delivery.
2. [Get us over the water, not build us a bridge](https://swizec.com/blog/get-us-over-the-water-not-build-us-a-bridge/). Focus on solving user needs, not on building features. Involve engineers early.
3. You're done when your code's in production.
4. The team is done when user needs are met.
5. Deploy _at least_ every day.
6. [INVEST](https://swizec.com/blog/how-do-you-break-down-a-large-project/) – independent, negotiable, verifiable, estimable, testable. That's a good story.
7. [Kick the can](https://swizec.com/blog/writing-software-is-like-kicking-a-can/). Make it exist first, then make it good.
8. [Discuss architecture _before_ you start coding](https://swizec.com/blog/coordinating-at-the-end-is-too-late/). Code review is for the small things.
9. Never ask for 2 big changes in the same PR. [Better is good](https://swizec.com/blog/better-is-good/).
10. [Approve with comment](https://swizec.com/blog/approve-with-comment/) – don't block progress for anything less than production blowing up.
11. Everyone owns their system. No throwing code over to QA, fix your own bugs. If you say it's good and it breaks at 3am, we know your phone number.
12. [You need observability more than tests](https://swizec.com/blog/why-you-need-observability-more-than-tests/). Save automated testing for core business logic and gnarly edge cases.
13. [Focus on architectural complexity](https://swizec.com/blog/why-taming-architectural-complexity-is-paramount/). Organize your code into modules by business domain, put effort into interfaces, don't worry about implementation details.
14. [Smart core, thin interfaces](https://swizec.com/blog/smart-core-thin-interfaces/) – share your business logic, repeat your interface. An API should hit the same code as a React server action, a NextJS/Rails/Flask view, React Server Component, or internal function call.

And a bonus principle: If you're building a reusable generic thing and don't have at least 2 distinct use-cases _right now_, you're not building a reusable generic thing. Make it great for the current use-case first.

Cheers,<br/>
