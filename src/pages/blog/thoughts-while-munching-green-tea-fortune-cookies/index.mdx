- **Green tea is here to stay.** Yes, yes, that doesn’t strike you as a risky call. After all, green tea is a staple drink of millions—probably billions—of people. Why would it suddenly fall into disfavor and be consigned to the history books as a once-popular drink? But that’s the point: I repeat myself… [green tea](http://wildandbare.com/our-teas/green-tea/) is here to stay. It is healthful, probably more beneficial to human health than we even understand today, wonderful to sip, and pleasurable to serve. Count on it still being served in 3012.
- **Handmade Imperial Tai Ping Hou Kui has more accolades coming its way**. From the orchid aroma that wafts from the cup to the sweet and fresh taste of the liquid itself, this tea definitely is “imperial” in its presentation and consumption. I predict that anyone lucky enough to get some of this tea from [Wild & Bare Co.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_%26_Bare_Co. "Wild & Bare Co.") will enjoy a tranquil hour savoring the tea.
- **Handmade Premium Bi Luo Chun has a sweet future**. This East Mountain tea from [Jiangxi Province](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=27.6333333333,115.766666667&spn=1.0,1.0&q=27.6333333333,115.766666667 (Jiangxi)&t=h> "Jiangxi") is a wonderfully fruity brew thanks to the peach, plum, guava, and other fruit tree groves growing in the neighborhood. It is a fresh tasting tea suitable for any time of day. When you tote up its appeal—1) fruity, 2) zesty, 3) enjoyable to sip morning or afternoon—it is no wonder its stock is expected to climb in the years ahead.
- “**Chinese fortune cookies”—conceived in America using a Japanese cookie recipe—are more tasty than revelatory. **Case in point: The cookie bakers never gave a clue that a stomach ache would result from eating too many of them. Who could have known!

_Chef Jean Alberti was raised in a family restaurant near Strasbourg, France. Jean carefully studies the unique soil characteristics and production methods at each tea garden he visits. Guided by local artisans whose families have grown heirloom tea for generations, Jean has curated a line of organic Chinese teas of peerless quality and authenticity._
