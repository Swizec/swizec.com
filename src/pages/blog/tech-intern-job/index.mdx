Here&#x27;s the deal, I&#x27;m a solopreneur working nights and weekends on this _Turn programmers into engineers_ business and I have more ideas than time. So I&#x27;m looking for an intern to help me out.





Why an intern? Three reasons:



1. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough work for an experienced software engineer
2. I think the tasks wouldn&#x27;t be challenging enough for an experienced engineer
3. Cost; this is a small bootstrapped business



## What I&#x27;m offering



I can&#x27;t promise you piles of money and I can&#x27;t say you&#x27;re going to build software used by millions. Such is life :)



What I _can_ offer is a paid learning opportunity.



You&#x27;ll work remotely and part-time to implement various solutions big and small in JavaScript, React, and associated web technologies. We&#x27;ll start small and go bigger as time goes on.



I don&#x27;t care where in the world you are, as long as your English is good enough that we can understand each other smoothly.



When you hit a snag, I&#x27;m here to help. If you need to buy a book or a course to learn something, I will buy it for you.



Think of this as a way to practice solving real problems. You are encouraged to leverage this experience into finding a real real job.



## Your job



Your job will be to implement things I don&#x27;t have time for, so I can focus on producing content. This will involve:



- improvements to swizec.com
- building features for learnwhileyoupoop.com
- evaluating opensource libraries
- building example code
- build and improve landing pages



The tech stack is a combination of React and Wordpress. You&#x27;re encouraged to leverage existing solutions instead of reinventing the wheel.



## How we&#x27;ll work together



We&#x27;re going to communicate primarily through Slack. Video calls when necessary.



We&#x27;re going to have daily checkins and generally keep in touch while working together. You are encouraged to reach out to me whenever.



You&#x27;ll be paid via PayPal or TransferWise every month based on an hourly rate we&#x27;ll figure out together. If neither PayPal nor TransferWise work for you, we can figure something out.



## How we&#x27;ll find out if we&#x27;re a fit



For hiring, I&#x27;m prioritizing [slope instead of y-intercept](http://qr.ae/TUphry). That is to say, I want you to be a fast learner not someone who already knows a lot.



You should have basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, HTML, etc. I&#x27;ll give you the chance to learn the rest.



The initial hiring process is going to go like this:



- you&#x27;ve already reached out to me, probably 👍🏼 (unless you&#x27;re reading this on my blog)
- after too long a wait, I replied (sorry 😅)
- you send me something you&#x27;ve made
- **I teach you something**
- **you use the concept to build an example app**
- I&#x27;ll use what you&#x27;ve built to gauge your slope



My hope is that even if we don&#x27;t end up working together, you will still have learned something useful and built a little something you can add to your portfolio. That way I&#x27;m not wasting your time.



### Next step



Our next step is a **live webinar on June 13th at 9pm Pacific** on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/SwizecTeller).



If you can&#x27;t make it, don&#x27;t worry. The video will stay available forever, but I encourage you to come say hi and ask questions. This is your chance to evaluate me as well.



We&#x27;re going to cover an intermediate React concept or two.



## ✌️



If all that sounds good, see you at the webinar. Hit reply, send me something you&#x27;ve built (school and book/course projects are perfect), and ask your questions :)
