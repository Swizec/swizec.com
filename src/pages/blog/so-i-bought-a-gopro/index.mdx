... and these things are magic. If there&#x27;s anything that says _&quot;You live in the future, man&quot;_, it&#x27;s a camera half the size of your [computer mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29 "Mouse (computing)") making video at resolutions almost unheard of five years ago. \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;]![GoPro compared to a mouse](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ipPiZUozRumDCtwLGST0 "GoPro compared to a mouse") [GoPro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro "GoPro") compared to a mouse\[/caption] Ever since the HD Hero came out in 2010, I&#x27;ve wanted one. No idea what I&#x27;d use it for, but it seemed _so cool_. All those action shots of professional athletes flooding the internets whetted my appetite. And now it&#x27;s mine. It&#x27;s finally mine! Mwahahaha. As a responsible adult I waited for the right moment to buy the new toy. They aren&#x27;t expensive, but at $300 for the mid-range version, they aren&#x27;t super cheap either. Of course, in Slovenia the same package costs about 400 euro, so currently being in the US helped a lot. I bought the GoPro for two reasons:

1. I wanted to take cool shots of last Sunday&#x27;s paintball game between everyone at [Dwellers](http://www.dwellers.com/). But I didn&#x27;t because there was nowhere to mount the camera.
2. August Longboard Roadtrip. Need I say more?

Stuck a mount on my helmet, connected my phone to the camera, and went for a cruise around Stanford and [Menlo Park](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.4541666667,-122.178611111&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.4541666667,-122.178611111 (Menlo%20Park%2C%20California)&amp;t=h> "Menlo Park, California") to &quot;make a video of the area for my friends and family back home&quot;. Bollocks, just wanted to play with the toy! But the video turned out great. If way too long. It was dusky when I went out, but the 170 degree angle and fancy camera settings I will never understand made the video even brighter than reality. Since when don&#x27;t cameras need obscene amounts of light to make quality video anymore? Despite its size the camera feels surprisingly heavy on the helmet. Then again, it _is_ encased in a waterproof shell that will withstand practically any impact you throw at it. _And_ you can still click all the buttons! \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;384&quot;]![GoPro case](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MF5hp8fvTr6LEmBL7QzR "GoPro case") GoPro case\[/caption] But my favorite feature is the wi-fi. The GoPro can create a [wi-fi hotspot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28Wi-Fi%29 "Hotspot (Wi-Fi)") that you connect to with your phone and use an app to control the camera. You can see the preview - there&#x27;s even a delay that makes it useful when the camera is on your head - turn on recording, adjust all the strange settings and turn the camera on and off. There&#x27;s even a feature that makes the camera beep so you can find it when it jumps off your head and into some bushes after a gnarly crash. \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;384&quot;]![in-app camera preview](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/H01uRWFvQOCiZcwVOCmX "in-app camera preview") in-app camera preview\[/caption] \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;384&quot;]![App mode switching](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kSkBnDGSueVlvYfWbXrg "App mode switching") App mode switching\[/caption] You don&#x27;t want to see the two videos I made of Stanford, they&#x27;re long and boring, so here&#x27;s a video of me falling on a hill near [Xerox Parc](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.403,-122.149&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=37.403,-122.149 (PARC%20%28company%29)&amp;t=h> "PARC (company)") and chasing the longboard down the hill when it ran away.
