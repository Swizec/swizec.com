Where I say it&#x27;s better to stand up when editing? It works! Only problem is I get kicked out of the kitchen around 4pm, just about an hour after I really properly get to work. Today I want to talk about a little pet peeve I&#x27;ve developed with English over the past few days.

Since my d3.js book is supposed to be very inclusive and inviting I use the [first person plural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person") a lot. It just sounds better when going through examples to say &quot;Here we do X&quot; instead of a preachy &quot;You should do X&quot; or a self-absorbed &quot;I did X&quot; ... you know, like this post. As such there are a lot of instances where I write &quot;Let&#x27;s do something or another&quot;. _Let&#x27;s_ being a contraction of _let us_. Now _let_ is a funny little verb in the English language. It&#x27;s got no fewer than eight meanings, adding some [verb phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase "Verb phrase") and idioms the number goes all the way up to [_nine-teen_](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/let?r=75&src=ref&ch=dic). Talk about overloading operators, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/ "Scala (programming language)") can hide in shame before the might of English. Let&#x27;s - see how I sneakily used the [possessive form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive "Possessive") and not a contraction of let us - primary meaning is roughly &quot;to allow&quot;, so when you say &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot; you are pretty much saying &quot;Allow us to go!&quot;. But with slightly less imperative in your voice. All fine and good. But in the book I also talk about third parties a lot. It&#x27;s not just me and the reader that are having fun, behind the scenes d3.js&#x27;s functions are working hard to keep us happy. I often write &quot;This or that function lets us do this or that&quot; _lets us_ Using &quot;lets us&quot; feels more appropriate than saying &quot;allows us to&quot; or even &quot;enables us to&quot;, especially when I&#x27;m supposed to be shortening my manuscript by 60 pages before publication. And it just feels snappier and better paced than the alternatives. Here&#x27;s the dilemma: &quot;lets us&quot; works in some cases, &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; in others and &quot;let&#x27;s us&quot; is far out. Laughably wrong. And one of those appears almost in every other paragraph. Paragraph after paragraph, page after page, for 180 pages. Every single time I see those six letters I have to stop, take a deep breath, and make sure they are correct. Every. Single. Time.
