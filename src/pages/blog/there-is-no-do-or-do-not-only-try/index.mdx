> No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try. \[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; caption=&quot;A green guy&quot;]![A green guy](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/e/e0/Yoda_SWSB.jpg "A green guy")\[/caption] ~ Some Green Dude

That&#x27;s solid advice right there. You shouldn&#x27;t _try_ to do this. Just do it. Or don&#x27;t, if you decide it you don&#x27;t want to for whatever reason. Another movie had a similar philosophy: _&quot;You either [karate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate "Karate") or you do not karate. Karate so so. You beat up.&quot;_ Here&#x27;s the thing though, that advice is absolute **bollocks.** We live in a probabilistic universe - even if you _do_ do instead of try, you are at the mercy of [probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability"). Our actions are [stochastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic"), so are the actions of others. Even the basic physical forces acting on things are ... stochastic. Ever studied the development of robots? Most of it goes into dealing with probabilistic actions in a probabilistic universe. Most of the time when we &quot;do instead of try&quot; we aren&#x27;t even dealing with just ourselves, there are many moving pieces. People even. With their own stochastic thoughts and decisions. Whenever you decide to **do** what you&#x27;re really doing is something more like: _&quot;Okay, I will do everything within reason to achieve this. If more information reveals it isn&#x27;t worth the effort, I won&#x27;t. If something more important comes up, I won&#x27;t.&quot;_ Sure, commit yourself fully, but remember you&#x27;re only _trying and hoping for the best_.
