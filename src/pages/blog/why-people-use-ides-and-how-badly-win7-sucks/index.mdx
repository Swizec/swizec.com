Just a quick thought on an early morning ... After having battled with the quintessential question of modern programming for several years I have finally figured out why people use IDE&#x27;s and why many of them are so adamant about having this and that gizmo and this and that helping view and whatnot cluttering their work environment. It&#x27;s all because they&#x27;re **still** using an OS \*cough\*windows\*cough\* that doesn&#x27;t support [virtual desktops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop "Virtual desktop"). What. The. Fuck. Why would anyone DO that? O.o ... makes no sense whatsoever What&#x27;s perhaps even funnier is that even Windows 7 doesn&#x27;t support virtual desktops. This, in my humblest of opinions, makes it antiquated by roughly 10 years at its release. Sad.
