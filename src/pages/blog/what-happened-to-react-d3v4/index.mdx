In December or November last year, I made a string of big promises. I&#x27;m gonna have the [all new version of React+D3v4](https://gum.co/mTWg) ready by Christmas, it&#x27;s gonna be amazing, there&#x27;s an interactive video course coming in January or February, and a brand new D3v4 cheatsheet. All the things!



It is now May.



All I&#x27;ve achieved is that I pissed off my girlfriend. Working over Christmas was a dumb idea, and I&#x27;m dumb for having thought of it.



Book… good progress, valiant effort, still not done. I have all the new examples and projects. I&#x27;ve finished all the theoretical parts and the big fat practical part. I&#x27;ve done the animation bits as well.



Interactive course and videos… haven&#x27;t even started. Gotta finish the source book first!



Here&#x27;s what happened:



In November, I started talking with Shoutem, and we came up with [React Native School](http://reactnative.school). Originally my plan was to finish React+D3v4, leave a month of buffer to recuperate, then dive into building a new React Native app every two weeks for React Native School.



That did not quite work out. But I still had to start React Native articles in February. That&#x27;s [been going pretty well](http://reactnative.school). New app almost every two weeks, the trip to Europe messed up my schedule a bit, but I&#x27;m getting back into it.



Because of the increased workload though, I haven&#x27;t been able to work on the book as much. Or at all, really.



**BUT** on my flight back from Europe, I was able to touch up and fix the Redux animation particles example. It&#x27;s shiny and useful and fits React 15.5.x now.



Then over the last week of jetlag early mornings, I kept writing and writing, and now the canvas section is done. A whole brand new section on using HTML5 Canvas to build declarative bitmaps and making your animations speedy.



Even finished the first React + Canvas example. The particle generator pushed to 20,000 elements. It&#x27;s great.



So here&#x27;s the deal: By the end of this month, I&#x27;ll have the book fully finished. The missing parts are:



- [n-body collision simulation with D3, MobX, and Canvas](https://swizec.com/blog/n-body-collision-simulation-react-d3-mobx/swizec/7497) example
- [Dancing tree fractal](https://swizec.com/blog/dancing-tree-fractal-react/swizec/7288) and comparison of React alternatives
- some tips on performance



That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s all I have to write to finish the book. I can totally do that in the next 3 weeks even while doing React Native School. Especially because the two big chapters already exist as blog posts. That makes it easier.



Wish me luck.
