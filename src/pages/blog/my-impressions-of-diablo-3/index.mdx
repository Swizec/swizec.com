## Oh glorious Diablo 3

Luckily Diablo 3 works on a Mac and I have one of those Mac laptop thingies. I've heard people have huge problems trying to run the beta on Wine. This is one of those times I'm super happy I don't religiously go for open source stuff. :P ![Vomiting rainbows](./img/photos-images-newsfeed-000-085-444-1282786204310.jpg "Vomiting rainbows") Unfortunately my poor laptop is a bit old and while the game runs mostly fine, the physics are a bit ... slow. Despite what I used to think in primary school, no this does not give you more time to think about your actions. In a word, Diablo 3 is _**FUN!**_ And when I say fun, I mean vomiting rainbows and farting daisies fun. My favorite new feature is definitely that you can _use the dungeon itself_ to kill monsters. Pull a lever and a chandelier falls down on a group. Marvelous! The experience is in fact so awesome I will probably buy this game. Then crawl into a hole for a week and shut everything down. No Twitter. No facebook. No school. Nothing. Just Diablo 3. Hell, I've never even bought a game before if it wasn't by an indie developer. And even that I only ever bought [World of Goo](http://www.worldofgoo.com "World of Goo") and [Machinarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium "Machinarium").

## Not all is perfect :(
