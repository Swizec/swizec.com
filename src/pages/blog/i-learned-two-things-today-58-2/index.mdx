![Something Is Expected](https://swizec.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/300px-Something_Is_Expected_Cover2.png)

Today I learned that an abundance of studying can be damaging to the brain and general well-being of a person.

You can tell something is wrong when at some point you find yourself trying to calculate the [expected value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of a [random variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) defined as `{2,2,2,2,2,2,2}` using the long form. And you even use so much sense as to shorten everything up by just multiplying the sum of all probabilities with 2! (essentiall 2\*1)

Yep, I actually wrote out two whole members of the [summation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) series before realizing what I was doing ...

Another thing I learned is that I actually did write down that [thing I said yesterday I didn't write down](https://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-48/), but forgot I had written it down. What I had learned yesterday was that levenshtein distance and hamming distance are pretty similar beasts. The first is a measure of the number of changes you need to perform to turn a string into a different string, whereas the latter is only about the number of substitutions to be performed.

And yes, that passes for super interesting these days.
