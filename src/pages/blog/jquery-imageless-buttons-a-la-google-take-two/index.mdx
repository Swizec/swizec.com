On Monday I released these buttons and as many of you noted I seriously didn&#x27;t do nearly enough testing and what&#x27;s worse, I even bragged about the fact. But some of you perhaps noticed my edits to the blogpost where I said I&#x27;d make it all better. Well, here&#x27;s Wednesday and I made it all better while still, as promised, spending much less time than Google probably did. Think I&#x27;ve spent under 20 hours for the whole thing from inception to finish (now). If you&#x27;re lazy just head over to the [jQuery imageless buttons a la Google examples/documentation](http://swizec.com/code/styledButton) page.

Let&#x27;s start off with a screenshot of what the buttons look like on modern browsers

I spent a good deal of last night making sure they also look like this on many older browsers, in fact these are now officially supported:  
Opera 9.6x  
Firefox 3  
Firefox 2  
Safari 3  
Safari 2  
Internet Explorer 8 beta  
Internet Explorer 7  
Internet Explorer 6  
Chrome

And I seriously hope that&#x27;s enough for your needs, if supporting all of those isn&#x27;t enough for you then I&#x27;m not certainit&#x27;s even possible to satisfy your needs. Personally I must admit I&#x27;ve learned a lot in getting all of these browsers to work. Most of all that Firefox 2 doesn&#x27;t have an inline-block, but rather a -moz-inline-block for some strange reason. It&#x27;s also interesting to not that Safari 2 and IE break when you have trailing commas in your lists of properties, which I&#x27;m used to so it&#x27;s easier to add stuff.

Anyhow, here&#x27;s what the buttons look like in Firefox 2

And what they&#x27;re like Internet Explorer 6

I should probably also note that there are two known issues with the buttons. Namely that in Internet Explorer onchange events don&#x27;t work since it doesn&#x27;t allow firing them on noninput elements and that in IE the darker border on the right vanishes on activated buttons for some reason, I was simply too tired to hunt this one down and you know what, I can live with a minor glitch such as that.
