I don't always get to work on mobile projects, but when I do they're websites pretending to be apps.

So the question is: If your schedule is too tight to get a simple phonegap application through the approval process, how do you deliver a great mobile experience to users on launch day?

Responsive design will only get you so far. Which is to say not very far at all.

Take Bootstrap, use all the responsive features and you are left with a website that looks a bit different on a phone than it does on a computer or a tablet. But it's no app.

- renders super small despite the _initial-scale=1.0_ [meta tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element "Meta element")
- scrolls all over the place

First step to fixing things is disabling user scalability:

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1.0"
/>
```

Default zooming is okay now and users can't [pinch-to-zoom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch_gestures "Multi-touch gestures") anymore. But they can still do plenty of strange side-scrolling and bouncing around. Something apps don't usually do.

Adding another meta tag fixes that problem.

```html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
```

Our only problem now is that pesky [address bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar "Address bar") on the top. Apps don't have that! This can be solved with a bit of simple javascript:

```javascript
// When ready...
window.addEventListener("load", function () {
  // Set a timeout...
  setTimeout(function () {
    // Hide the address bar!
    window.scrollTo(0, 1);
  }, 0);
});
```

Marvelous! You even get an extra 60 pixels of room to play with.

Just keep in mind that you _must_ use those 60 pixels, otherwise the address bar won't hide because there's nothing to scroll up.
