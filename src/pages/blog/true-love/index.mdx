My girlfriend isn&#x27;t a drop-dead gorgeous person, in fact I&#x27;m certain to many she doesn&#x27;t even seem attractive. She&#x27;s a tad on the chubby side, has strange fingernails, weirdly positioned teeth, strange jaw-bone structure, could do with a tad better cheekbones, her eyes aren&#x27;t properly aligned on her face, she doesn&#x27;t have long legs and doesn&#x27;t seem to know how to make herself look better with make-up and clothing. She&#x27;s not even that great personality-wise, she&#x27;s whiny, sulky, has a lot of baggage and she&#x27;s prone to burst of such deep despair it makes your heart shrivel up and die.

But you know what? None of that really matters and I hope she doesn&#x27;t change any of it save for the personality stuff. It&#x27;s what makes her her and I enjoy every little imperfection I can find because to me she&#x27;s the prettiest and awesomest person there can be.

That, I believe, is true love. I&#x27;m still not quite certain how it comes about, but at least I&#x27;ve now figured out what it is ... it&#x27;s knowing all of your partner&#x27;s flaws and simply not finding them at all important. To knowingly be with someone despite all their problems and imperfections, what else could that be than love?

Despair perhaps, a fluke of monogamic social organisation ... but let&#x27;s call it love for now.
