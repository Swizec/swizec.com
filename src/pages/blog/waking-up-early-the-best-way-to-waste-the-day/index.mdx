![How rising early makes me feel](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nothingproductiveallday.gif "How rising early makes me feel")

1.  Those who are nightowls
2.  Those who are morning larks
3.  Those who wake up so early they might well be nightowls

While I've yet to meet any type 3 human in person, they are quite vocal on the internets. Rising anywhere from 4am to as early as 1 or 2am ... are these superhuman persons nightowls or morning larks? It's hard to say. I'd wager the real mornings larks are those waking up at 6 and 7am _and liking it._ Many have been forced into the schedule by other morning larks, but some do like it. Others are left to feel like the dirty slobs of this world. Waking up at 10am!? Are you a rockstar? No. Then you're a bum!

The main advantage supposedly being that you can get more out of the day, make it magically longer and just all 'round better spent. All early risers seem to agree on this one. _You're wasting most of the day getting up at 10am, you slob!_ they'll say, then feel smug about their [early rising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_up_early "Waking up early") and how much longer days they're having. Smug as a bun.
