5 years ago I moved to America to chase a dream ðŸ‘‰ stop selling time.

![Lifetime product sales on Gumroad](./img/17iHr3I.png)

Back then I was a freelancer with an okay business. Focused on early stage startups in USA, kept up to 2 clients in parallel, and couldn't grow. Charging more was tough, selling more time impossible, business model hard to iterate. Cycles long and unpredictable.

You can read more about my freelance journey [in this series of articles](https://swizec.com/categories/freelancing/).

After a few shorter stints in USA (visa issues) in April 2015 I packed my 2 suitcases and left Slovenia for good. America or bust.

My business visa allowed a 6 month stay.\[^1]

A former client raised a seed and moved to SF proper. When they heard I was back in town they offered a full-time job, a raise, and help with the visa.

I said yes, fired my clients, and got to work.

This helped on two fronts:

0.  My freelance income was not enough to live in SF like an adult. Sharing an apartment with my girlfriend and 5 room-mates, mehhhh
1.  Visas are expensive and hard to get without a sponsor. Especially the O-1 visa I wanted because it doesn't involve lotteries. More of that story in [How I got a visa normally reserved for Nobel laureates](https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-got-a-visa-normally-reserved-for-nobel-laureates/)
2.  A job provides stable income for stable time. You show up, do the work, get paid. No chasing clients, no marketing, no fuss.

Building a product business is hard enough. You don't need to build a freelancing/consulting business at the same time.

With life sorted out, I could now lean into info products on nights and weekends and chase initial traction from before.

First goal ðŸ‘‰ get to $20k in the bank and stop living paycheck to paycheck. It took 2.5 years.

## Why info products

Products are how you move away from selling time. You create an asset and it sells while you sleep. That's the goal.

The problem with selling time is that it doesn't compound. You do a week of work, get paid lots, and that week never pays again.

With products, you do a week of work, get paid a little, and it keeps paying. Week after week, month after month.

Takes luck and orthogonal assets, but that's the idea.

Info products are like playing products on easy mode. Easier to develop and faster to ramp up than a SaaS business. You're selling information to people who want to learn a thing better faster.

But unlike a SaaS business, info products have a reverse growth curve. Splash at first then taper off. SaaS is slow at first then ramps up.

![SaaS vs Info product](./img/NVfbbIC.png)

Look around. Many successful entrepreneurs start with info products to make fast money then switch to SaaS to get off the treadmill.

Also I'm better at destructuring ideas and writing than I am at product management.

## Why America

Growing up in the 90's and 00's, America was _the_ land of opportunity. The place where anyone can go and make it with hard work and a bit of luck.

Economic prospects back home felt meh.

When everyone says you're either making less than $40k or you're a crook, that's not a great environment to push harder. You can't fight your environment forever.

Best find people who push you.

Slovenia is full of folk like that, but they get lazy. Reach up above the average, make more than anyone says is reasonable, and you stop striving.[^2]

That doesn't happen in San Francisco. There's always more.

And people are more encouraging here. _"Hey I made $X with this thing"_ is met with _"Wow cool, why not $2X??"_

Fire. Under. Ass.

## Assets going in

Going into the info product business, I had a few things going for me. Assets I could leverage to help me succeed.

_An asset is anything you have that can be used to make money or increase opportunity._

### I knew how to business.

Nothing extraordinary, but I knew that you need leads, you need to sell to those leads, you need to talk about benefits not features, you need to charge for work, and I knew how to do basic accounting.

All things I learned by being a self-employed freelancer and reading everything I could from [Brennan Dunn](https://brennandunn.com), [Amy Hoy](https://stackingthebricks.com), [Patrick Mckenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/), [Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com), and [Nathan Barry](https://nathanbarry.com).

Yes that includes paying thousands of dollars for their courses over the last few years :)

### I had tried info products before

By April 2015 I had spent a few years trying to turn my famous [Why Programmers Work at Night](https://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night-2/) essay into a business as a book. ðŸ‘‰ [nightowlsbook.com](http://nightowlsbook.com)

It didn't work but I learned a lot. Lifetime sales of about $6000.

### I had an audience

After almost 10 years of consistent blogging â€“ yes I started in high school â€“ I had built an audience. People were subscribed to my RSS, there was a few thousand followers on Twitter, and I knew how to write an article that people read.

What I didn't have was an email list. Because I was dumb and thought email was dead. RSS is gonna win! Social is best! Who even reads email???

Adults read email that's who. Adults with money and problems to solve.

### I had initial traction

I published the first version of [React for DataViz](https://reactfordataviz.com) as a $10 ebook on Leanpub in March 2015.

https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/577401306429685760

It made a couple thousand dollars. Great success!

![great_success giphy](./img/media-a0h7sAqON67nO-giphy.gif)

React was on the rise and _everyone_ wanted to give it a whirl. Combining React with data visualization gave my material an edge, an angle different than the rest.

**You have assets too**

Anything can be an asset. Look around. Know people? Got skills? Have ideas? All those can be assets if you use them like assets ðŸ˜‰

## The mindset hacks

The biggest obstacle to success, I've found, is yourself. Hidden beliefs you might not know you have.

For example I grew up knowing that having money is bad and makes you a bad person. This had to go. Reading [Ramit Sethi](https://iwillteachyoutoberich.com) helped.

### Your expertise is worth big cash

Another common belief among programmers is that information is free, code is open source, and charging for either makes you a bad person.

And that's why you have billion dollar companies relying on free hobby work from opensourcerers. Fuck that shit.

Watch this talk: Fuck you pay me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U

Watch until you get it.

**Modern society uses ðŸ’° to signal value.** We pay for what we value. If you work for free, that's on you. Find someone who values what you got or change what you offer.

Reading [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/) and [Kai Davis](https://kaidavis.com/) helped here. [Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/) came later with Hourly Billing Is Nuts.

Why do work that society doesn't value? Ain't nobody got time for that. Charge.

### Time is value

You can always make more money, learn more things, or buy more crap. But you can't get back your time. Once gone it's gone.

That means you have to value your own time. Use money to buy time as soon as you can. More on this later.

### Work for value not effort

Many of us grow up thinking that _effort_ is what you're paid for. Nobody gives a shit how hard you work, mate. They care how much value you bring.

You can work really really hard, toil for months, to polish a turd. Make it real shiny and smooth.

But it's still a turd. I'm not buying that shit.

That's why big companies pay more than small companies. Why San Francisco pays more than Ljubljana. Why site reliability engineers make more than CSS wizards.

And why you should quit any job at a failing startup.

### Think in assets

Lastly, you have to start thinking in assets.

What can you build today that will produce returns beyond the time you spend cranking the crank?

Is it a marketing funnel? An article with good SEO? A relationship with a client? A relationship with your boss or coworker? A product? An audience?

Build assets.

### My secret mental super power

This is a mindset I learned from 2 sources: my mom and Jack Sparrow.

> It doesn't matter how you feel, you either get it done or you don't.

![It doesn't matter how you feel, you either get it done or you don't.](./img/TsWtssT.png)

That's it. Shut up and work.

## Market trends and landscape

> A rising tide lifts all boats.

Find a rising tide, put your boat in the water, and swim. That's all the wisdom I have here. ðŸ˜…

Build your business in a growing market. For a growing audience at least. If you don't, your life will be hard.

That way you don't need to steal market share from your competitors. You can work _with_ your competitors. You all win!

I benefitted from this by going after React and D3.

React grows absurdly fast â€“ [r/reactjs doubled its size this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dzuy8h/this_sub_has_grown_50_since_july/). That's the kind of market you want to attack.

D3 has gone from a niche library when I published [Data Visualization with D3.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/data-visualization-d3js) in 2013 through Packt, to _the_ library you use for dataviz.

## The core info product strategy

The core info product playbook is simple:

1.  Find a growing audience
2.  Build authority in that audience
3.  Create a product
4.  Sell
5.  GOTO 2

You can extend the life of your products
