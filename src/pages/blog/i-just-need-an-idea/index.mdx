You know what&#x27;s the best way to learn a new technology? Build something. You know the best way to stand out as a job applicant? Build something. Best way to make $1000/month on the side? Build something. So why aren&#x27;t you building something my friend? Why isn&#x27;t there a little passion project in your life that occupies your nights and weekends? Why aren&#x27;t you jumping out of bed every morning to do a little hacking before dayjob.exe starts? Let me guess: You don&#x27;t have an idea? Poppycock.

## &quot;I don&#x27;t have an idea&quot; is the commonest excuse



You&#x27;re not alone.



I remember talking to a friend a while ago. She was going through a life transition. Changing jobs, leaving the safety of a startup that jump-started her career, figuring out what to do next.



_&quot;Well, what do you want?&quot;_, I asked.



_&quot;What I really want is to start a business&quot;_



Okay then do it. You&#x27;re well connected, just start.



_&quot;Yeah but I don&#x27;t have an idea&quot;_

She got a job at an early-ish stage startup. Owns a product category. Kind of like a baby startup within a startup. It&#x27;s pretty cool.



Hell, a few years ago I was grabbing coffee with a founder friend. Downtown San Francisco, beautiful day, okay coffee. Back then the city felt like an exciting wonderland full of opportunity. The future. Now it just feels like home.



_&quot;Swiz, you&#x27;re wasting time with this freelancing nonsense. You&#x27;re a great guy, why don&#x27;t you just start something real?&quot;_



_&quot;I don&#x27;t have an idea.&quot;_



End of conversation.



## Why we say we don&#x27;t have ideas



I think it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re afraid. It&#x27;s easy to say you don&#x27;t have an idea.



Nobody can fault you for not starting, if you don&#x27;t have an idea. What&#x27;re they gonna do? Force you? Point and laugh? Call you silly?



No of course not. _&quot;I don&#x27;t have an idea&quot;_ ends the conversation.



You can&#x27;t start without an idea.



But really, I think you _do_ have ideas my friend. I think you have plenty of ideas. You&#x27;re just afraid.



Afraid they&#x27;re not big enough. Afraid you&#x27;ll fail. Afraid you can&#x27;t do it. Afraid others will judge you. Afraid you&#x27;ll waste your time.



Afraid.



It&#x27;s easier never to start. Safe in your mind that little kernel of idea stays perfect. Unchanging.



Nobody will ever know but you. You always could&#x27;ve been great, you just didn&#x27;t have an idea.



Struck a nerve? Hit reply
