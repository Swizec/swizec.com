You've heard of [Lake Bled](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.3644444444,14.0947222222&spn=0.1,0.1&q=46.3644444444,14.0947222222 (Lake%20Bled)&t=h> "Lake Bled") right? The only lake in [Slovenia](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.05,14.5&spn=10.0,10.0&q=46.05,14.5 (Slovenia)&t=h> "Slovenia") containing the only island in Slovenia? Right!? Oh it's just one of the most beautifulest places in Slovenia.

Yesterday I walked all over the bad boy!

The really amazing thing about Lake Bled is that every couple of years it completely freezes over. To the point you can take a walk right up to the island and endure one of the biggest brainfucks possible.

Every fiber in my body fought against that first step. There you are, standing on the shore and ... you take another step. And it works. You're on water. It's a lake. And you're standing on it!

Then you take a nice long walk to the island - about a kilometer and a half one way. The whole thing is just profoundly _weird._

Being out there in the middle of the lake isn't too strange, feels kind of normal until you look back and realize everything looks _wrong_. You've been coming here your whole life, but it was ... different.

The way back is even odder. Land slowly inching towards you with every step you take and your brain slowly but surely realizing that something odd is going on here.

Then you have some delicious cake.
