Thought leaders on the internet always rail against overtime. It's exploitative, it leads to burn out, it's evil.

They're right.

If your boss asks for overtime, push back. If it's a habit, quit. If every project is a death march, quit *and warn others*.

But not all overtime is bad. Do it when:

1. *You* want to
2. You're excited
3. You're learning a transferable skill
4. The result makes *your* job easier
5. The result makes others' job easier
6. Everyone will be excited and it feels like you're hand-delivering a Christmas present

I found an easy way to fix important problems with our test suite. Problems we've been crying about for over a year. Problems so bad we feel dread when it's time to write a test. Problems that make half our tests kinda useless. Problems that come up week after week in every meeting where tests are mentioned.

The proof of concept looks promising. I've been waiting all week to try the idea.

It's going to be a great article ðŸ˜›

And so I code, for work, on Saturday at 7AM. Because I can't wait to say *"Team, I have a Christmas present for you all"*
