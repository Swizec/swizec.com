Late Friday afternoon two of my mates, @zidarsk8 and [@smotko](http://twitter.com/smotko), start talking about a Saturday [surfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing "Surfing") trip to the cold windy waters of [Medulin](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=44.8219444444,13.935&spn=0.1,0.1&q=44.8219444444,13.935 (Medulin)&t=h> "Medulin"), [Croatia](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.8,16.0&spn=10.0,10.0&q=45.8,16.0 (Croatia)&t=h> "Croatia"). They invite me along. What the hell, I might as well go, been meaning to try surfing ever since I was in the US with [@zidarsk8](https://twitter.com/zidarsk8) in 2011. _Sure, I'll go!_ _Okay, we pick you up at 5am. Bring a towel and some sammiches._ I regretted the decision immediately.

> this is a perfect beginner spot /sarcasm chopy [waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") and sharp rocks and strong onshore. The good thing about this is, if you liked this, then it can only get better, because these were the least surfable waves you'll ever see, probably. ~ @zidarsk8, the next day
