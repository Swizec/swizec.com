It's no secret that I think [the cult of TDD](https://swizec.com/blog/25-lessons-from-25-years-of-coding/#2-tests-are-great-swbut-tdd-is-a-cult) leads you down a dark and stormy path towards brittle code with a false sense of security.

Clean isolation, mocks for all things impure, interfaces designed for ease of testing over ease of use. The sense of achievement is immense. Look at all those green checkmarks 💪

And outside a few special cases with [complex logic or algorithms](https://swizec.com/blog/how-tests-uncover-hidden-complexity-in-simple-code/), it means boopkis to your production code.

![2 unit tests, 0 integration tests](./img/2-unit-tests-0-integration-tests1674g1.gif)

Most business code is JSON bureaucracy: shuttling data from one side to another. Transforming formats. Joining data streams. Abstracting knowledge domains and business processes.

You know how to write a loop and [TypeScript ensures you hold the code correctly](https://swizec.com/blog/learn-typescript-in-5-minutes/). Unit tests don't add much.

## Fakes over mocks

Unit tests isolate too much.

While fantastic for complex algorithms and gnarly logic, they break down for JSON bureaucracy. They don't test the right things.

Take this test for example:

```typescript
describe("getOAuthToken", () => {
  it("should call the db with the tokenReference successfully", async () => {
    const tokenReference = "tokenReference"
    const tableName = "oauth_token"
    await oauthService.getOAuthToken(tokenReference)
    expect(db).toBeCalledWith(tableName)
    expect(db().where).toBeCalledTimes(1)
    expect(db().where).toBeCalledWith("internal_reference", tokenReference)
  })
})
```

Verifies that calling `getOAuthToken` talks to the database and uses the `tokenReference` to fetch a row. The database is mocked and this test is pure. Runs on your machine with no external dependencies very fast.

A beautiful example of a great unit test. 👌

Do you think it's a useful test?

### How stubs and mocks fail

What happens if we change the table name? This test won't notice.

What happens if we change the table structure? This test doesn't even check.

How do you know the code does anything of value? The test pretends to check, but you can make it pass with useless code, if you want.

```typescript
export async function getOAuthToken(): Promise<Token> {
  db("oauth_token")
  db("random_table").where("internal_reference", "tokenReference")

  return {
    access_token: "123",
    refresh_token: "afefaw",
    expires_in: 3600,
  }
}
```

Call the correct table then call a `.where()` with hardcoded params on a random table. Return an unrelated value of the right type. 💩

We're using [Jest with TypeScript](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-configure-jest-with-typescript/) which ensures the return types must match. At least there's that.

You won't be mean like this in your project, I hope. It can happen by accident. When someone unfamiliar with your code makes a change that breaks it in a way that mocks obscure.

### Stubs and mocks test a strawman

Stubs and mocks construct a strawman and test _that_, not your code. This is a lesson Google learned at scale – [stubs and mocks make bad tests](https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-software-engineering-at-google/#stubs-and-mocks-make-bad-tests).

But full integration testing is slow, resource intensive, and hard to get right. The more complex your production environment, the harder it is to simulate.

To quote David Wells, an early developer of Serverless Framework: _"Forget about local testing, you can't replicate AWS on your machine"_.

The solution are fakes. This also is a lesson Google learned at scale and put in their wonderful [Software Engineering at Google](https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-software-engineering-at-google/) book.

Fakes are lightweight implementations of the services you need. Maintained, ideally, by the team who makes that service.

## pg-mem is a fake database for your tests

[pg-mem](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem) is a pure in-memory implementation of Postgres. The perfect solution for database tests that sit in that sweet spot between pure unit and full integration. 😍

You get database reads and writes, guarantees around data consistency, migrations, and zero overhead. Your tests run in memory, as fast as always.

pg-mem achieves this through [Olivier Guimbal](https://github.com/oguimbal)'s herculean effort. The madman built his own SQL parser and reimplemented an almost full-featured clone of Postgres in TypeScript.

## What pg-mem looks like in practice

See [the example repository](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-configure-jest-with-typescript/) for the full setup. It's based on my [How to configure Jest with TypeScript](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-configure-jest-with-typescript/) from a while back when I thought this article would be "next week". 😅

For this example we're using [knex](https://knexjs.org/), a query builder, to talk to the database and [pg-mem](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem) for testing. The project doesn't do anything useful, it exists to show off testing.

### Use Jest manual mocks to fake your database

[Jest manual mocks](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks) are the perfect place to implement a fake. You build a lightweight implementation of your code and Jest uses it in tests.

For the database example, you take this db connection file:

```typescript
// ./src/db.ts
import knex from "knex"
import knexFile from "../knexfile"

export default knex(knexFile)
```

And add its fake counterpart in a sibling `__mocks__/` directory:

```typescript
// ./src/__mocks__/db.ts
import { newDb } from "pg-mem"
import knexFile from "../../knexfile"

const mem = newDb()

export default mem.adapters.createKnex(0, knexFile) as typeof import("knex")
```

The original `db.ts` file configures knex to connect to your database. You can `import db` and run SQL queries with `db('table_name')` throughout your codebase.

The `__mocks__/` version uses the same config, but instantiates an in-memory pg-mem instance and connects to that. Unless you're doing something special, the rest of your code should Just Work. It has no idea the database is fake 🤘

### Setup the pg-mem database

Your fake database needs to be in the right state to run tests. Have the tables, the seed data, etc.

That happens in `jest.setup.ts`, a test setup file that runs before your tests. Configured by the `setupFilesAfterEnv` value in `jest.config.ts`.

```typescript
// jest.setup.ts
import db from "./src/db"

// enables the fake database for all test files
jest.mock("./src/db")

// run migrations
beforeAll(async () => {
  await db.migrate.latest()
})

// close connection
afterAll(async () => {
  await db.destroy()
})
```

We import the faked `db` file, enable mocking for every test, and run migrations before anything else. After tests are done, we close the connection so Jest doesn't hang.

### Write better tests with a fake database

Take that `getOAuthToken` example from before. Here's the function itself:

```typescript
export type OAuthToken = {
  access_token: string
  refresh_token: string
  expires_in: number
  internal_reference: string
}

export type OAuthTokenRow = OAuthToken & {
  internal_reference: string
}

export const getOAuthToken = async (
  tokenReference: string
): Promise<OAuthToken> => {
  const tokenRow: OAuthTokenRow = await db("oauth_token")
    .where("internal_reference", tokenReference)
    .first()

  return omit(tokenRow, "internal_reference")
}
```

Talks to the database and returns the first row of the `oauth_token` table that matches the `tokenReference`. Omits `internal_reference` before returning the value because that's an implementation detail. I think. We could debate on that.

How would you write a test for this function?

Here's what I did:

```typescript
// ./src/__tests__/oauth-service.ts

describe("oauth-service", () => {
  let token: oauthService.OAuthToken, tokenReference: string

  beforeEach(() => {
    tokenReference = Faker.datatype.uuid()
    token = {
      access_token: Faker.datatype.string(20),
      refresh_token: Faker.datatype.string(20),
      expires_in: 3600,
    }
  })

  describe("getOAuthToken", () => {
    it("should read the oauth token from db", async () => {
      await db("oauth_token").insert({
        ...token,
        internal_reference: tokenReference,
      })

      const oauthToken = await oauthService.getOAuthToken(tokenReference)

      expect(oauthToken).toEqual(token)
    })
  })
})
```

Construct a fake OAuth token, insert into the database, use the `getOAuthToken` function. Compare that the result matches expectations.

Now you can rely on this test to tell you if something's wrong.

Table got renamed? You get a SQL error.

Table structure changed? The result no longer matches unless you fix the function.

Made a typo in your query or aren't using the params? The test will tell you.

### You get better insert tests too

The insertion counterpart to `getOAuthToken` looks like this:

```typescript
export const insertOAuthToken = async (
  tokenReference: string,
  token: OAuthToken
) => {
  return db("oauth_token").insert({
    ...token,
    internal_reference: tokenReference,
  })
}
```

Gets an `OAuthToken` and its internal reference, saves to the database.

How would you write this test?

Here's what I did:

```typescript
describe("insertOAuthToken", () => {
  it("should insert a token", async () => {
    const [{ count: prevCount }] = await db("oauth_token").count()

    await oauthService.insertOAuthToken(tokenReference, token)

    const [{ count: afterCount }] = await db("oauth_token").count()

    const newToken = await db("oauth_token")
      .where("internal_reference", tokenReference)
      .first()

    expect(afterCount).toEqual((prevCount as number) + 1)
    expect(omit(newToken, "internal_reference")).toEqual(token)
  })
})
```

Compares row count before and after insertion, verifies it increments. Fetches the inserted value and verifies it matches expectations.

Another great test would be to verify what happens, if you try to use a non-unique `tokenReference` and insert twice. The code currently has a bug I think.

## Principles of good DB testing with pg-mem

1.  Test the data gets inserted
2.  Test the right data gets inserted
3.  Test the inserted data gets returned
4.  Avoid hardcoded values with [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)

Now all I'm missing from Rails is something like [Factory Bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) for convenient test models and data factories. The search continues

PS: you can use the `__mocks__` approach to write a lightweight fake of any file. Like a 3rd party SDK, a fake microservice, or an API 😍
