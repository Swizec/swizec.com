_\[This post started the challenge to understand 52 papers in 52 weeks.

Kudos to her! This got me thinking, what is that one thing I have always wanted to do, but haven&#x27;t had the right motivation? I already [write](http://swizec.com/blog/a-year-of-750words-com-with-shiny-graphs/swizec/4378) and [exercise](http://swizec.com/blog/30-day-fitness-experiment-with-results/swizec/6326) every day so that&#x27;s that for the obvious challenges. But I don&#x27;t read enough. Sure I probably ~~spend~~waste upwards of two hours a day reading things online, but that&#x27;s like fast food for the brain. Whenever I hit something deeply interesting that will take more than five minutes to read I just close the tab after five paragraphs. I&#x27;m a terribly slow reader too. Last time I measured it took me half an hour to read 10 pages of Hemingway. Part of the problem is that I like reading books when I&#x27;m comfortable and then I keep dozing off no matter how much fun I&#x27;m having. Books are out of the question then. I read three or four per year, start reading six, buy eight, and that&#x27;s good enough. But I&#x27;ve always loved reading academic papers. Those bastions of bleeding edge research, the ten page blogpost of a scientist and their team, written in that loving academic drone of a voice, with all the chest-thumping fancy words so you don&#x27;t even think to doubt the author&#x27;s intelligence. In my experience it takes some three to four hours of furrowed eyebrows and meaningful grunts before you understand a serious academic paper enough to explain it. Six if it&#x27;s not from your field. Eight if it&#x27;s biology. Biology is hard okay. But it&#x27;s effort well spent! I have never walked away from an academic paper without having learned something deeply interesting and insightful. The challenge: Read and explain one paper per week for a year. 52 papers, 52 weeks. Simple. I am going to read papers from all fields. Sometimes this is going to mean extended research to figure out the backstory, other times it will be simple. But I don&#x27;t know where to find all those papers. If you have an interesting paper you&#x27;ve been meaning to get to, but just haven&#x27;t found the time. I am your man!
