For a long time now I&#x27;ve been completely in love with [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") to the point that I write functional-style code even in run of the mill normal languages. There are many reasons I like functional code, the paper _[Why functional programming matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html)_, by John Hughes sums up my opinion perfectly. A few days ago I came upon a problem that killed my idea of functional code being superior and awesome beyond belief. This might have happened because I&#x27;m not a very good functional programmer yet, or the tool I was using (javascript) just doesn&#x27;t support the right things ... but I doubt I would have written it any better in clojure. The problem is one of turning a list of values, say, _\[A, B, C, D]_ into a list of pairs with itself, like so _\[\[A,B], \[A,C], \[A,D], \[B, C], \[B,D], \[C,D]]._ Should be simple enough right? You just make another list shifted by one to the left, make a zip, then repeat until the second list is empty. This solution turns out to be horrible, looks ugly and I&#x27;m not even going to show it. So here&#x27;s my second functional solution ... it&#x27;s a lot cleaner.

```
function pairs_functional2(data) {
    return _.reduce(_.map(_.range(1, _.size(data)),
                         function (i) {
                             return _.map(_.rest(data, i),
                                          function (item) {
                                              return [data[i-1], item];
                                          });
                         }),
                   function (memo, pairs) {
                       _.map(pairs, function (pair) {
                           memo.push(pair);
                       });
                       return memo;
                   }, []);
```

A little [syntactic sugar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar "Syntactic sugar") wouldn&#x27;t hurt ... writing a lambda in javascript isn&#x27;t the cleanest of beasts. That final reduce down there also isn&#x27;t the best of things from a functional standpoint. I don&#x27;t like that push, but honestly I didn&#x27;t know how to do that better. Here&#x27;s an iterative solution for comparison:

```
function pairs_iterative(data) {
    var out = [];
    for (var i=0; i < _.size(data); i++) {
        for (var j=i+1; j < _.size(data); j++) {
            out.push([data[i], data[j]]);
        }
    }
    return out;
}
```

I haven&#x27;t looked at performance, but both implementations are functionally the same ... I&#x27;m feeling a bit at a loss here. Am I doing something stupid in the first implementation? Or is this just the kind of problem that fits iterative programming better than functional? I&#x27;m tempted to do an implementation in clojure just to see if this thing looks so ugly in javascript on account of the syntax ... PS: the original implementation uses underscore.js so it works in all browsers just as the iterative would. Also I don&#x27;t think javascript natively has enough such functions ... it would be even uglier.
