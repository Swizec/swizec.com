React is here to stay. It solves many problems you may not even know existed. These essays are the good stuff I learned over the years.

Learning from tutorials is easy. You follow some steps, learn a smol lesson, and feel like you got dis ðŸ’ª

That's where my emails come in â€“ lessons from experience. Building production software :)
