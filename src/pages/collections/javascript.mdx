Learning from tutorials is great! You follow some steps, learn a smol lesson, and feel like you got this. Then you go into an interview, get a question from the boss, or encounter a new situation and o-oh.

Shit, how does this work again? ðŸ˜…

That's the problem with tutorials. They're not how the world works. Real software is a mess. A best-effort pile of duct tape and chewing gum. _You need deep understanding, not recipes_.

I took a bet on JavaScript in 2005 when it was known as DHTML. It's been my favorite language ever since. These essays are the good stuff you can't learn from a tutorial.
