## What happens when your startup hits the hockey stick?

Customers are flooding in, deadlines are relentless, and your engineering team is drowning in technical debt. Scaling isn't optional â€” it's survival.

In _Scaling Fast: Software Engineering Through the Hockeystick_, veteran startup engineer Swizec Teller shares hard-won lessons from building and leading teams through hypergrowth. From women's health startups scaling to nine-figure Series B rounds, to biotech platforms going from zero to eight-figure revenue in just three years, this book is a practical guide to thriving when demand explodes.

You'll learn how to:

- **Scale the business** without losing sight of product-market fit.
- **Scale the team** with trust, delegation, and high-output culture.
- **Scale the tech** while balancing speed, quality, and technical debt.
- Use **feature flags, small-a agile, and continuous delivery** to keep shipping.
- Recognize when to let small fires burn â€” and when to fix them fast.

Drawing on real startup war stories, this book shows what works (and what doesn't) when your company is growing faster than your systems can handle.

ðŸ’¡ _If you liked **Accelerate**, **The Phoenix Project**, **Team Topologies**, or **The Lean Startup**, Scaling Fast gives you the engineer's playbook for surviving â€” and thriving â€” in hypergrowth._

Whether you're an engineer joining your first rocketship, a tech lead managing rapid growth, or a founder trying to scale without breaking everything, this book will help you **navigate chaos, build resilient systems, and keep your company moving forward**.
