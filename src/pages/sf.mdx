**What happens when your startup hits the hockey stick?**

Customers are flooding in, deadlines are relentless, and your engineering team is drowning in technical debt. Scaling isnâ€™t optional â€” itâ€™s survival.

In *Scaling Fast: Software Engineering Through the Hockeystick*, veteran startup engineer Swizec Teller shares hard-won lessons from building and leading teams through hypergrowth. From womenâ€™s health startups scaling to nine-figure Series B rounds, to biotech platforms going from zero to eight-figure revenue in just three years, this book is a practical guide to thriving when demand explodes.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:
	â€¢	**Scale the business** without losing sight of product-market fit.
	â€¢	**Scale the team** with trust, delegation, and high-output culture.
	â€¢	**Scale the tech** while balancing speed, quality, and technical debt.
	â€¢	Use **feature flags, small-a agile, and continuous delivery** to keep shipping.
	â€¢	Recognize when to let small fires burn â€” and when to fix them fast.

Drawing on real startup war stories, this book shows what works (and what doesnâ€™t) when your company is growing faster than your systems can handle.

ðŸ’¡ *If you liked **Accelerate**, **The Phoenix Project**, **Team Topologies**, or **The Lean Startup**, Scaling Fast gives you the engineerâ€™s playbook for surviving â€” and thriving â€” in hypergrowth.*

Whether youâ€™re an engineer joining your first rocketship, a tech lead managing rapid growth, or a founder trying to scale without breaking everything, this book will help you **navigate chaos, build resilient systems, and keep your company moving forward**.
