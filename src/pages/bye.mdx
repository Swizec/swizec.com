Thank you for reading my letters for as long as you did. You're the best.

I appreciate your unsubscribing instead of hitting the spam button. It really means a lot forever these emails reaching the people who want to keep reading. And I never want to send anything you don't want to read :)

Got 2 minutes to tell me why you're leaving?
