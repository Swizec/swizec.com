Hello React Summit audience person! ðŸ‘‹

You probably just watched my talk â€“ You do have time to build it twice - and scanned a QR code or followed a link. You're wonderful.

Hope you enjoyed the talk and got a feel for what a wild ride it's been to rewrite an app while growing the company 5x in a year. Then another 5x the year after.

I'm writing a book right now on how to approach software rewrites while _increasing_ your velocity. Published by Manning.

If you'd like to know when the book is ready, get early previews, or just follow along as ideas develop ðŸ‘‰ [sign up below](https://swizec.com/letters).
