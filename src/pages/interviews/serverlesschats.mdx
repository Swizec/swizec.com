[Serverless Chats ep #135](https://www.serverlesschats.com/135/)

## Talking points

- If you can JavaScript, you can back end
- The future belongs to full stack front end engineers
- Modern backend is a JavaScript function
- JavaScript is a great language and anyone who can code JavaScript can pick up any other language
- A lot of what used to make JavaScript really ugly was interacting with the Dom
- Front end is more like a full fledged app
- GraphQL is kind of an escape for backend engineers
- How should a full stack or how should a front end engineer approach serverless?
- Database and Variable Naming Conventions: Snake Case vs Camel Case
- [Serverless Handbook](https://serverlesshandbook.dev) for Front End Engineers
- Architecture principles and how to create good serverless developer experience
- Your average tutorial can make you a mediocre engineer, how to break out of that cycle

## Quotable Quotes

"I never want to touch an Apache config ever again" - ST

"There was this JAMstack revolution that happened over the last couple of years" - ST

"we've now had react for almost 10 years and everyone's still happy with react, which is honestly a huge accomplishment for the JavaScript ecosystem" - ST

"one of the coolest things about JavaScript programmers is that I feel like JavaScript is relatively easy to get started with, especially since we have ESX and modern JavaScript, is surprisingly, it's actually a very reasonable language" - ST

"JavaScript is kind of a lot like in the English language where it mugs programming languages in dark alleys and picks off all of the best stuff from their pockets and adds it to JavaScript." - ST

"JavaScript is the only language, that I know of at least, where every device on the planet has a JavaScript execution environment." - ST

"So you can write code for literally anything, like Android can run JavaScript. iOS can run JavaScript. A lot of people don't know this but your TV set top box is actually a web browser." - ST

"JavaScript is a really fast language now." - ST

"if you stick to the good parts of JavaScript, It's a really reasonable language. That's fairly easy to use, quick to understand." - ST

"I think it's become kind of the lingua franca of the web." - ST



"as things have progressed and certainly with node.js coming out, you know, the basic of what you can do with any programming language you can do with JavaScript now." - Jeremy


"But if you're writing something like React or Vue or you're using NextJS or any of those things, you're writing a lot of JavaScript." - Jeremy

"And if you can do that, those skills translate really, really well to node.js." - Jeremy

"We were talking with Tomasz Lakomy and he was saying that he thinks front end development is actually harder than backend development now." - Jeremy

"a lot of what used to make JavaScript really ugly was interacting with the DOM. And now with these modern frameworks, you're literally just writing JavaScript and letting somebody else handle the DOM" - ST

"The hardest part, in my opinion, is domain modeling and data management and deciding what to do with state and where it goes and where it doesn't go" - ST

"every time I talk to real customers or real world business people, I'm like, wow, this is so much harder and more complicated than anything I've ever seen in a tutorial or a textbook" - ST


"The real world is so complicated. And that's the hard part of software engineering" - ST

"pure REST and graph ql are very similar in that they give you full direct access to objects on the database" - Rebecca

"With graph QL you've just smooshed that into one request so that it's technically more performant and you get articles and authors together in one request" - Rebecca

"back end engineers are telling front end engineers. 'Dude, you're really asking me for weird stuff here. That's very hard to get. Why don't you get it yourself?' So that's where I think full stack engineers shine because we can, we get to do both parts of that. So we only get to be angry at ourselves." - Rebecca

"the nicest thing about serverless is that it abstracts away a lot of the gnarly parts of the backend" - ST


"my ideal Serverless server is basically a JavaScript function written in node.js that accepts some arguments." - ST

"some people don't realize this, but your database will work just fine if column names are in camel case." - ST




"it feels like, 'Oh, if I add Postgres to my thing, or if I add Mongo, it's suddenly it's slow. It's not actually slow. It's just the connection takes awhile." - ST


"personally really liked the serverless framework because it's a really good middle ground /../ it gives you all of the power, but it makes the simple things easy" - ST

"Why go base jumping when you can write raw CloudFormation" - Jeremy


"one of the big surprises, if you're coming at this from the front end is just realizing how flaky distributed systems can be." - ST


"I wanted to write Serverless Handbook in a way that will stand the test of time as much as possible." - ST

"The ideal these days, and that's actually possible is, you can deploy multiple times per day. It's not something anyone even notices it's all behind like feature flags and you just push something out, test it in production, and see if it works." - ST


"if you talk to somebody from five years ago, would you test your code in production? Obviously write some unit tests and integration tests to make sure of the baseline, but would you test your code in production?" - ST


"that's where like these fast deploys and quick iteration cycles come in, that you can do with modern tooling. You can immediately see if it's the right thing. If it breaks anything and then iterate from there." - ST

"essentially you have to test in production cause you're not going to find the edges unless you can observe what's actually happening with the systems and distributed systems tend to work really well when they're small" - Jeremy

"at some point in your career, hopefully as early as possible, you have to go beyond tutorials towards actually understanding what you're doing and understanding the 'why' behind those tutorials" - ST


"Like when I started serverless, I would ask someone who's really good with backend systems. And I would ask a stupid question and they were like, that question doesn't even make sense. You don't understand enough of what's going on here to even ask me a question that I can help with." - ST

"you have to push in that direction where you can kind of just take bits and pieces of different recipes, put them together and make something new." - ST

"with enough practice and with enough trying, you get to the point where somebody can come with a problem that nobody has ever solved before. And that's where I think the really fun software engineering begins." - ST

"you find yourself in this position where you're the sole leading expert in the world, in that particular, tiny part of your niche." - ST
