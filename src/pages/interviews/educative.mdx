> Swizec Teller started his career coding PHP websites for $5/hour, now he leads teams at hyper growth startups in Silicon Valley. Along the way he learned a new senior mindset focused on business outcomes and ownership. He learned what makes these startup engineers special.
> Why they make those crazy salaries despite not being any better at writing code. Now he wants to share that with the world at [SeniorMindset.com](https://seniormindset.com).

- first trips to Silicon Valley
- how the startup mentality applies to engineers
- why feedback beats perfection
- Swiz describes a popular meme pic in audio (and nails it)
- where coding education falls short
- what's the incentive to improve, if bad code works fine
- how _do_ you improve anyway?
- how much does technical debt matter
- what inspired my Senior Mindset journey

## Quotable quotes

"everyone's really going for a certain kind of attitude towards coding, but they don't really tell you what it is" ~ LN

"you will have time to build it twice later. And this took me a really long time to grasp" ~ ST

"it's not necessarily about trying to get it perfect. It's really just trying to get it done" ~ LN

"you would rather have an imperfect, barely working feature next week, than the perfect version of that feature two months from now." ~ ST

"it's all about getting fast feedback cycles" ~ ST

"You see optimization in your own messes when you're first kind of writing drafts" ~ LN

"the problem in studying CS is that you're never writing code that you will ever have to maintain" ~ ST

"if you're coding at your cleverest and how will you ever be smart enough to debug it" ~ ST

"You get exposed to a lot of very interesting things, but you're also the one who is getting hit over the head and banging your head against the wall, trying to break through" ~ ST

"you can simulate mentorship by swallowing your pride and putting things out there in public and seeing how people react and getting feedback" ~ ST

"there's no right or a single way to go about coding it all depends" ~ LN

"I thought I was crushing it. And then I got a performance review and they were like, dude, you're the best engineer we have. But all the other stuff that makes a senior ... oof" ~ ST
