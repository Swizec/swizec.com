"A quote that really changed my mind in this perspective was from a CTO a couple of companies ago, who said, 'Look, dude, it doesn't matter how good the code is. If we don't survive, like we need to survive first, then we can focus on code quality'" - Swizec Teller

"If it doesn't provide business value, you might as well throw it in the garbage, like it doesn't matter" - Jonathan Stark
