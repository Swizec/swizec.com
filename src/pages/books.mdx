Creating dynamic data visualizations on the web is a pain in the ass.

You either have to use dumbed down libraries that won't let you do what you want, or make everything from scratch. Every time.

You want a quick way to build complex visualizations. Build once, use everywhere. In every project. Don't believe me?

With React + D3v4 you'll learn how to build re-usable visualization components in about an hour.

When you're learning d3.js on your own you often feel like Step 1: Draw two circles, is followed by Step 2: Draw the rest of the owl. My book aims to bridge that gap.

I guide you through complete examples from basic shapes on a page to full blown visualisations. There is no magic here, no steps left unexplained. You will understand everything that goes into making a visualization with d3.js.

## [Why programmers work at night - 2012](https://nightowlsbook.com)

[![Why programmers work at night cover](../images/why-programmers-work-at-night.png)](https://nightowlsbook.com)

The early bird does not always catch the worm, sometimes it meets a cat.

Programmers often work on unusual schedules that do not jive with the modern 9-5 office culture. They don't even do their best work at offices.

This book shows programmers and those around them that there's a better way.
